-- The homework page: what the book is asking you to go and do, as a checklist.
--
-- It used to be the collection's seventeen quests with a meter against each --
-- the library's own list of holes, read out a second time so that one number
-- could be printed beside it. That number now hangs under the demand on the
-- shelf where the demand is (src/library.lua) and this page is the thing the book
-- did not have: a list of what you have *done* rather than of what you have
-- opened. See src/challenges.lua for why those are two different questions and
-- why a register of maxima can only ever ask the first.
--
-- Nothing is answered here, so nothing is scribbled: the boxes are drawn, and
-- stray ink fades. Done is ink, undone graphite, and a standing demand is red --
-- which is the library's own pair of colours for its own pair of states, because
-- it is the same fact twice.
--
-- **A row is a name, its pips, a demand and a figure.** The pips are the one
-- thing on this page that is not on any other: a challenge usually has three
-- rungs, so it has three boxes, and each fills red as its rung falls. One row
-- however long the ladder, because three rows saying BLOB with different numbers
-- on them is a list you cannot run your eye down.
--
-- **And eight sections, one to a spread** (src/spread.lua), for the reason the
-- canteen has its own: this list is going to keep growing and a page is
-- a page. Ten rows a section is comfortable on the shortest window this game is
-- ever handed; forty in a column would not be. Where the window is wide enough
-- to hold two leaves the ten are split down the crease, five and five, and a
-- finger drag turns to the next section the way it turns a page; where it is not
-- -- a phone held upright -- the spread collapses to one leaf and the ten go
-- back in a column, with the same drag lifting the whole page away.
--
-- Split down the middle rather than filled to the foot of the verso and spilled,
-- because five and five reads as a spread and nine and one reads as a page that
-- ran out.
--
-- Everything is measured across *every* section rather than across the one
-- showing, so no column moves as the page is turned -- the library's rule, and it
-- matters here for the library's reason: this is a screen you read by running
-- your eye down it.
--
-- **What does not turn is not on the page.** The heading -- the name of the
-- section, which is the title of the page -- and the count in the corner are
-- drawn out past the overprint pass with the corner button, and the rows are
-- drawn inside it. That split was cosmetic while a section changed in one frame;
-- with a leaf moving across the page it is what decides what moves with it, and
-- the answer is the list -- the title and how much of it there is are the book
-- rather than the leaf. There is no footer: the page is turned by dragging it.
