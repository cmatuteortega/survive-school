-- is to read this either side of the passes that are the run's fire (Game:update,
-- Loadout:mend). Which works because every hit in the game arrives through one

--
-- Neither of them is worth a number on the row (Enemy.types). A hit on a paper
-- clip and a hit on the boss are the same event -- something landed -- and a
-- boss that flinched less would read as a boss that was not hit rather than as
-- a boss that is heavy. What says how much it was worth is the number the page
-- throws (src/damage.lua); this says *that* it happened, and it says it the
-- same way every time so it can be read out of the corner of an eye in a crowd
-- of two hundred.
--
-- The whole thing is over in about a tenth of a second, which is the point: at

-- Add a row here to add a monster; the spawner picks from this table by name.
-- Every row walks at the player, and every block below is a way of not *only*
-- doing that. None of them is a special case anywhere else in the game: each is
-- read in one place, and a row without it is the row this game shipped with.
--
-- **`name`** is the one field on a row that nothing in a run ever reads. It is
-- what the *book* calls the thing, for the one screen that names monsters out
-- loud (src/challenges.lua, where a row is one body count a homework list is
-- kept of) -- so a new monster brings its own line of homework with it and there
-- is no second list of what the horde is made of to keep in step. Written here
-- in English, like every other string in the game, and translated at the draw
-- (src/i18n.lua).
--
-- **`shot`** makes it a shooter. It still walks at the player like the rest, but
-- every `every` seconds, if the player is within `range`, it spits a pellet
-- (Game:updateEnemyShots) that flies at `speed` and hits for `damage`. `spread`
-- and `arc` make it a volley: `spread` pellets fanned across `arc` radians
-- instead of the one straight down the line.
--
-- **`keep`** stops it walking all the way in. Past `at` it closes like anything
-- else; inside `at` it circles; inside `back` it retreats. Only a shooter has any
-- use for one, and what it buys is the difference between a shooter you meet
-- because it came to you and a shooter you have to go and get (Enemy:update).
--
-- **`charge`** makes it commit. Every `every` seconds, with the player inside
-- `range`, it stands still for `wind` seconds wearing a red outline, then runs
-- `time` seconds down the heading it locked *at the start of the wind* at
-- `speed`, then stands `rest` seconds getting its breath. The heading is stale
-- on purpose: the whole attack is dodgeable by stepping aside during the wind,
-- and it is the only thing in the game that asks for a decision inside half a
-- second rather than over several.
--
-- **`split`** makes it two problems. When it dies it leaves `count` of `into`
-- thrown `spread` pixels out (Game:splitEnemy), carrying the parent's own
-- difficulty scale rather than the run's current one -- what came off a monster
-- is as hard as the monster was. `blown` is the one exception and is optional:
-- what a *blow-up* of the row leaves instead, at the run's own scale rather than
-- the parent's, because a child scaled up three times over stops being the thing
-- the row named.
--
-- **`burst`** makes killing it cost something. Where it died, everything inside
-- `radius` takes `damage` -- which is the player and nobody else, since a burst
-- that thinned the crowd would make these a *reward* -- and `puddle` is left
-- lying on the page (src/puddle.lua), so the ground the fight was on stops being
-- ground. Same bargain the boss's tear makes: it hits on the way and wets where
-- it stops.
--
-- **`knock`** and **`hold`** are what a shove and a glueing are worth against
-- it, both 1 for everything ordinary. They went in for the boss -- one that can
-- be bowled across the page by a pin is one you never have to look at -- and the
-- grin is the horde-sized version of the same idea: something the crowd-control
-- half of a build cannot fully answer.
--
-- Four more fields turn a row into a boss: `boss` (never despawns, never shoved
-- out of the way by the crowd, and ends the run when it dies), `pupil` (an eye
-- that watches you: the body is a ball painted a pixel at a time and turned to
-- face the player, with a gait of its own -- src/eyeball.lua), `trail` (a wet blot dropped behind it as it walks) and
-- `tears` (the same wet thrown rather than walked, three ways --
-- Game:updateTears).
--
-- The box the fight happens in is not one of them, and deliberately: an arena is
-- a fact about the *fight* rather than about the monster, so the spawner opens it
-- when it sends the boss (src/arena.lua) and nothing in this table knows.
--
-- Every *distance* written in a block above -- a burst radius, a pellet's `hit`,
-- a puddle's radius, a `spread` -- is the number for an ordinary arrival and is
-- multiplied by `reach` for a champion or a blow-up (Spawner:scale, Enemy.new).
-- Every *time* and every *range* is the number on the row for all three: a giant
-- eye fires a bigger pellet from the same distance on the same beat.

    -- and it should be, because it is the only one you could have avoided.

    -- the bomb, the sun, the storm, the beam -- so area is not really a choice,
    -- it is the default, and nothing on the page had ever made the player feel
    -- that. A blot killed by a stroke that also caught its three drops is a
    -- blot that cost one swing; a blot killed by a single pellet is three more
    -- things walking at you. That is the entire design.
    --
    -- 11hp and 16 speed puts it between a skull and a blob to fight and slower
    -- than either to arrive, because the drops are the real bill and it should
    -- not also be quick. It pays 1xp itself and lets the drops carry the rest,
    -- so ignoring one is not a way to be paid for it.
    -- `split.blown` is what a *blow-up* of it leaves instead, and a blot is the
    -- only row that has ever wanted one. Three times the size, the drops it would
    -- otherwise leave come off at three times the size too -- and a drop that
    -- wide is not a drop any more, it is a body wider than a grin with 2 health,
    -- which reads as debris rather than as three more fights.
    --
    -- What a giant blot leaves instead is three *blots*, ordinary ones, which then
    -- do what a blot does. So the row says the same sentence at both sizes -- this
    -- thing is two fights -- and the enormous one says it twice: one giant becomes
    -- three blots becomes nine drops, and the area you needed the first time you
    -- had to answer this is the area you need three times over.
    --
    -- It cannot run away with itself, and that is the whole reason the field names
    -- what a *blow-up* leaves rather than what a blot leaves: the children arrive

    -- one that dies at your feet is a hit you take.

    -- what keeps a chain from being fatal (Player:hurt): four going off together
    -- is one hit, exactly as wading through four puddles is.
    --
    -- 26 speed, quicker than a blob, because a bulb that never reaches you is a

    -- is standing on is page you have given up. 16 damage is the hardest contact
    -- hit in the table -- the one thing you must not do is let the slow one

    -- be bigger than the eye. Size is doing real work here: nothing about being

    -- ground you retreated over stops being ground. Every one of those is a
    -- thing you answer by moving, which is why it is slow -- a boss you cannot
    -- outrun would just be a big blob.
    --
    -- The hp is the one number here set by measurement rather than by design.
    -- A run holding every passive weapon at its last level puts about 30 damage

-- `scale` is how much harder the run has got since it started (Game:enemyScale)

-- is dealt. That is what makes a monster keep the numbers it walked on with: the
-- horde standing on the page when a cycle ends is the horde that cycle spawned,
-- and nothing already alive gets tougher because the clock rolled over. It is
-- also why hp, damage, xp and the radius live on the enemy while everything else
-- stays on the shared `def` -- those four are the only ones a scale touches, and
-- the radius is the newest and the odd one out: it is the first thing a scale has
-- ever changed that is not a number on a health bar but a fact about how much of
-- the page the thing is standing on (`grow`, below).
-- Health is rounded to a whole number and damage is not, and that asymmetry is
-- the one place a scale is allowed to be inexact.
--
-- What a player actually learns about a monster is *how many hits it takes*, and
-- with health this small -- a bat is 2 -- an unrounded multiplier turns that
-- into a fraction they cannot see and can only lose to. A blob on 4.14 health
-- takes two swings of a pencil that deals 4, and nothing on screen says why; on
-- 4 it takes one, which is the game's most basic sentence and worth protecting
-- for the minute the ramp leaves alone (HP_GRACE in src/spawner.lua). Rounding
-- to nearest rather than down, so the curve is not quietly discounted -- a bat
-- floored would spend most of a cycle on the 2 it was written with.
--
-- Damage is left fractional because the reading is the other way round: nobody
-- counts how many blobs it takes to kill *them*, they read a health bar, and a
-- bar is happy with a fraction. Rounding it would also snap the 18%-a-cycle
-- damage curve into jumps on the low numbers, where 4 to 5 is a quarter.
