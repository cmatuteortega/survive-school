-- A staple, driven into the page.
--
-- The pushpin's opposite number, and used identically: you tap the paper and
-- one lands where you tapped. Everything else about the two is the other way
-- round.
--
-- A pin is one big expensive decision -- most of half the meter, a quarter of a
-- second in the air, a 41px crater, and enough damage to kill everything caught
-- in it but the tank. A staple is a tenth of the meter, it lands the instant
-- you tap, it reaches 15px and it does 2, which is a bat and nothing else. It
-- is not an attack, it is a fastener. What it does is hold one thing to the
-- paper for two seconds, and the way you use it is to keep tapping: a row of
-- them across the front of the horde, or three into the blob about to reach
-- you.
--
-- Nothing about it is telegraphed, because there is nothing to dodge. The pin's
-- fall is what stops a tap on a moving target being a certainty; a staple has
-- no fall at all, and what keeps it honest instead is that hitting barely hurts
-- and the circle is small enough to miss with.
--
-- It goes in flat, or leaning a few degrees one way or the other, which is the
-- one thing a page full of them needs: twenty staples lying at exactly the same
-- angle read as a pattern printed on the paper rather than as twenty separate
-- decisions. The other thing a page full of them needs is `FOOTPRINT` below: the
-- page holds them one deep, so twenty separate decisions never pile into one
-- shape nobody made.
--
-- One fusion makes it sticky instead (`tacky` on the block, the CLINCH): the circle
-- is swept every four tenths of a second and anything standing in it is fastened
-- again, so the staple stops being a fastening aimed at one body and becomes a spot
-- on the page that holds whatever crosses it. Nothing else about the tool changes,
-- and the two endings below still end it.
--
-- When the hold runs out the wire comes back out of the paper (`Staple:prise`): a
-- fifth of a second of it lifting off the page, and then nothing left behind. It
-- used to stay for the rest of the run, and a page a long run had stapled read as
-- clutter long before it read as a record of anything -- so now a staple leaves
-- on the same couple of seconds a pushpin does.
--
-- One upgrade makes that tear a second hit (`prise` on the block): the wire bites
-- again as it comes. That is what the level buys, and what it buys with it is the
-- only hit in the game that cannot miss. What the crown caught two seconds ago is
-- standing exactly where it was, because the crown is the thing that has been
-- holding it there.
--
-- And one fusion takes the *clock* off that (`Staple:snag`, the SNAG in
-- src/tools.lua). A rubber dragged across a stapled sheet catches the wire and
-- takes it with it, which is a thing that really happens to paper -- so on that
-- row the tear is not something the hold runs out into, it is something a rub
-- comes and does, whenever you decide to go and do it. Nothing about the tear
-- itself changes except the one thing a hand pulling a staple out sideways
-- deserves: the crit is certain rather than rolled -- and the tear bites whether
-- or not the run bought `prise`, since a rub dragging wire through what it holds
-- is a hit on its own account. The two seconds stop being how long the fastening
-- lasts and become how long you have to get back to it.
