-- The purse: the one thing a run pays out that the next run still has.
--
-- Everything else a run leaves behind is a *record* of it (src/records.lua) --
-- the longest run and the biggest body count, one line per lesson, a maximum a
-- bad run cannot take away. This is the other kind of thing entirely: it is
-- earned, it adds up, and it is going to be spent. So it is not kept against a
-- lesson at all -- there is one purse and the whole book shares it, because what
-- it is being saved up for is in the canteen and the canteen does not care which
-- page you were on.
--
-- **What a run is worth is one function and this is it**, and it is five terms
-- at a rate rather than one number because a run comes back with five different
-- kinds of fact about itself and one about the terms it did them under. Every screen that shows the number asks here for it, exactly as
-- both end cards ask src/mark.lua for the grade, and none of them knows what is
-- in the sum -- which is what let the last two terms be added without a line
-- changing in src/win.lua, src/over.lua or the canteen.
--
-- - **The body count**, over a hundred and floored. The effort term, and the floor
--   is the point of it: a run that killed ninety-nine is worth nothing, which is
--   what makes the hundredth kill worth something.
-- - **The levels sold back** (`SKIP` in the draft, src/perks.lua), ten a piece.
--   The one term a run *chooses*, and the only place in the game where something
--   a run earned is turned into something the book keeps.
-- - **The grade**, a coin a rung. The term that pays for having lasted rather
--   than for having killed -- the ladder is the run's length divided into
--   thirteen (src/mark.lua), so this is a coin every forty-six seconds and
--   nothing else, and a run that spent ten minutes hiding behind pen lines
--   finally comes back with something. It arrives as the *rung* rather than as
--   the letter, and the caller reads src/mark.lua for it -- which is where the
--   cap that stops an endless run farming it lives, and is also what keeps this
--   file out of a require loop: a course reaches the purse, and src/mark.lua
--   reads the spawner's own clock.
-- - **The eye**, eight a piece. The cliff. The three terms above it all climb
--   smoothly, so without this the last ten seconds of a ten-minute run -- the only
--   part of it that is a *fight* rather than a crowd -- would be worth no more than
--   any other ten. It is per eye rather than a bonus for winning, so ENDLESS goes
--   on paying for the thing it is a bet on.
-- - **The coins**, one a piece, picked up off the page in the piggy bank's
--   fight (src/piggyboss.lua). The one term that is not reckoned at all: they
--   are coins already, the very coin the purse is drawn as, so one picked up is
--   one in the purse -- and they sit outside the course's rate below, because
--   the course has already paid for them once by making the fight they came
--   out of.
--
-- And then the whole sum but the coins is multiplied by the **course** it was
-- sat at (src/course.lua), which is the one term here that is not a fact the run
-- counted. It is a multiplier rather than a sixth term for the reason a course is
-- one dial rather than five: what a harder class is worth is *everything you did*
-- reckoned at a higher rate, and a flat bonus for enrolling would pay a doctorate
-- for walking onto the page. Three times at the top of the ladder, which is what
-- makes the ladder a bargain rather than a badge -- a doctorate pays for the
-- perks that make a doctorate survivable.
--
-- Which is roughly five times what a run used to come back with, and that is
-- deliberate rather than drift: the counter it is spent over (src/perks.lua) is
-- four cheap lines today and is going to grow rows that lock parts of the book
-- behind them, so the faucet was opened for what is coming rather than for what is
-- there. The four prices already on it are untouched and are now the near end of
-- it -- a first reroll is a middling run rather than two good ones.
--
-- Coins go out one way and come in two: a run ending, and the counter's third
-- section handing back everything bought on it (src/refund.lua). The second is
-- not really a *source* -- it is a purchase read backwards, and every coin it
-- pays came in through the first one on some earlier afternoon.
--
-- **A run is paid out when it ends, and only then.** The two endings are dying
-- and `END` on the win card, which is the same pair that turns `Game.resumable`
-- off, and `Game:cashRun` is the one door. Walking out through the pause card
-- deliberately pays nothing -- it does not end a run, it leaves one, and the run
-- it left is still there to be finished properly. That is also why nothing here
-- has to remember what it has already paid for: ENDLESS is not an ending either,
-- so a run that shuts the eye at four hundred kills and dies at nine hundred is
-- paid once, for nine.
--
-- The file is written the way a record, a design and the options are: plain text
-- in the save directory, a key and one number, and a line the game cannot read is
-- a purse that opens empty rather than a game that will not start.

Purse.PER_COIN = 100

-- What one skipped level is sold back for. Ten is two or three times the kill
-- payout of a run that reaches the eye, which is deliberate and is why the canteen
-- prices the SKIP line the way it does (src/perks.lua): the only perk that *earns*
-- is the only one priced against what it earns, so buying it is a bet that pays off
-- over a handful of runs rather than a tap that prints money on the first one. Move
-- this and move those prices with it.
Purse.PER_SKIP = 10

-- What one rung of the grade ladder is worth (src/mark.lua). One, so the whole
-- ladder is twelve -- three times the kills of a run that reaches the eye, which
-- is the right way round: the page is paying for the ten minutes rather than for
-- what happened during them, and what happened during them is the term above.
Purse.PER_GRADE = 1

-- And one eye. Eight is deliberately most of a grade ladder for the last ten
-- seconds of a run: everything else here is smooth in the clock, so this is the
-- one term that says the fight at the end was a different thing from the crowd
-- before it. It is also two thirds of a first RETAKE, which is the shape the
-- counter wants -- shut the eye once and a second life is nearly in reach.
Purse.PER_EYE = 8

-- What is in the purse. Loaded once at startup (`Game:load`) and written the
-- moment it changes, since the only thing that changes it is a run ending and a
-- run ends once.
Purse.total = 0

-- The one place the sum lives. Floored rather than rounded -- a coin is a whole
-- thing and a page cannot be handed three quarters of one.
--
-- One table rather than a row of arguments, and that is the whole of how a term
-- gets added without anything being told: the run is handed over as what it is
-- (`Game:runWorth` is the one place it is built) and a term nobody filled in is
-- worth nothing. A missing rung is the bottom of the ladder for the same reason,
-- and a missing course is high school -- which pays at one, so a caller that has
-- never heard of the ladder gets the sum this function always gave.
--
-- Floored at the end rather than on the kills, which is where it used to be. The
-- reason is the course: every term above was already whole coins, so the only
-- fraction in here was the body count -- and a rate of 1.4 makes a fraction of
-- all four of them. A coin is still a whole thing and a page still cannot be
-- handed three quarters of one; there is simply one place now where that is
-- settled instead of one term that needed it.
