-- The canteen: the counter the purse is spent over.
--
-- It was one of the two instances of src/blank.lua until there was something to
-- put on it, which is exactly the move that module's header describes -- a page
-- that grows anything of its own moves out into a module of its own and takes
-- what it needs with it. What it grew first was the purse (src/purse.lua), and
-- what it has grown since is the other half of that transaction: the things there
-- are to spend it on (src/perks.lua), each of them a level you own for ever and a
-- use you spend once a run. Three of them are spent on a draft and the fourth is
-- spent the frame the run would have ended, and the counter does not care which:
-- a row is a name, a price and a box whatever the thing at the end of it does.
--
-- **On a spread, the goods are on the verso and what they do is on the recto**
-- (src/spread.lua), one blurb on the line facing the row it belongs to. That is
-- not an arrangement invented for the fold: it is the only one the fold allows.
-- A leaf is half the page, and the widest blurb on this counter is wider than
-- everything else in a row put together -- so with the sentence in the words
-- column a spread cannot hold a row at all, and the counter degrades to prices
-- with nothing saying what they buy. Facing pages are what a book does with
-- exactly that problem, and it turns out to read better than the stacked
-- version: the left page is the transaction and the right page is the argument
-- for it. Where there is only one leaf nothing moves -- the sentence goes back
-- under the name where it has always been.
--
-- **Three kinds of thing are sold here, so the counter has three sections.** A
-- perk is a use a run spends, a hero is a hero (src/characters.lua) and a course
-- is how hard the whole book is (src/course.lua) -- the first is spent on a screen
-- the run has stopped for, the second decides who walks onto the page and the
-- third decides what he walks into -- and the note under the counter says which of
-- those you are looking at, which is the whole reason they are not one list: a
-- page printing EVERY LEVEL IS ONE USE A RUN over a row selling the starman would
-- be the counter lying about its own goods. They are stepped with the library's own footer (`<` the
-- section `>`), and the rows themselves know nothing about it: a row is a name, a
-- price and a box, plus a `shop` to ask the five questions a price needs answering,
-- and src/perks.lua and src/characters.lua answer those five the same way -- so one
-- function draws a reroll and a hero.
--
-- **And a fourth section that sells nothing.** REFUND hands back everything bought
-- on the other three at what was paid for it (src/refund.lua), which is one row and
-- the same transaction as any other as far as this screen goes -- a name, a price
-- and a box -- with one thing about it written down: `back` on the row, which is
-- what makes the figure read `+40` rather than `40`. It is a section rather than a
-- row at the bottom of one because it is about all three of the others at once, and a
-- row on the perks page that also sold your heroes back would be the counter's own
-- split broken by the one row that cannot respect it.
--
-- **And the shop, which is the only part of the counter priced in money rather
-- than coins** (src/store.lua). Its sections come after the refund, since the
-- purse never meets them: the lessons the timetable holds shut, three to a
-- section, and THE WHOLE BOOK with the two rows the store owes beside it --
-- RESTORE, and the ad consent form where the law asks for a way back to it. A
-- row there is the same name, price and box as any other, with `money` on it:
-- the figure is the store's own formatted price rather than a coin, and the box
-- opens the store's purchase sheet rather than spending the purse. Nothing is
-- owned until the store says so, and the row has no box while it is deciding.
--
-- The split also happens to be what makes the page *fit*: a box is twenty pixels
-- deep, so seven rows in one column is a counter hanging off the bottom of a
-- sixteen-by-nine page. That is not why the split is where it is -- it is where the
-- note stops being true -- but it is why there had to be one somewhere. The course
-- ladder is one row for the same reason it is one row in src/course.lua and not
-- three: buying a master's before a bachelor's is not a thing this book should
-- have to have an opinion about, and a line whose level *is* how far up you are
-- cannot express it.
--
-- **The purse is furniture and the counter is the page**, which is the split this
-- screen was laid out along before there was anything on the counter at all. What
-- you *have* hangs small in the top right at 1:1 -- the corner button's own margin
-- mirrored to the other end of the same top edge, and level with it -- and what
-- there is to *buy* is the body of the page, read down the middle from under the
-- heading. Buying does not move the readout and the readout does not move for a
-- purse that has reached a hundred: the room it keeps is struck off four figures
-- rather than off the number showing.
--
-- **Buying is the one thing on this page that is answered rather than pressed.**
-- Everywhere else in the margins of this book -- the tabs, the library's names, the
-- settings page's bars -- a press is a press, on the rule that choosing what to
-- look at is not a question and a quantity is not an answer. A purchase is neither
-- of those. It is a thing you cannot take back, and a box you scribble in is how
-- this game asks about one (src/scribble.lua) -- so each row has a box at the end
-- of it, it warms slate to blue to red as it fills, it commits when the pen comes
-- off, and the coins come out then and not before. A row with nothing left to sell,
-- or nothing in the purse to buy it with, has no box drawn at all and ink that
-- lands where one would be is ink on the page.
--
-- The box is *wiped* after a purchase rather than spent (`Choice:clear`), which is
-- the studio's RESET doing the same job: a counter you can only buy one thing at
-- is a counter you have to leave and come back to.
--
-- And the page it is all drawn on is whichever lesson you opened it from: the book
-- is still open there and you have turned to the back of it.
