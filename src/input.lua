-- One movement vector and one drawing pointer, however they were produced.
--
-- Desktop: WASD/arrows to move, mouse to draw.
-- Touch:   a thumb stick in the bottom-left corner, and any other finger draws.
--
-- The stick is drawn (see src/hud.lua) at a fixed home in the corner, but it is
-- not pinned there: press anywhere in that corner and the ring jumps under your
-- thumb, which is what makes it usable without looking at it. Push past the rim
-- and the ring follows your thumb, so it can never run out of travel mid-sprint
-- and leave you walking into the horde at half speed.
--
-- That following is on a leash. A run is one long hold -- the thumb is almost
-- never lifted -- and a horde is fled in one general direction for a while, so
-- an origin that followed without limit would ratchet: every push past the rim
-- displaces it for good and nothing brings it back until you let go, and after
-- a minute of that your hand is in the middle of the page you draw on. Within
-- STICK_LEASH of where the thumb landed the ring follows; at the boundary it
-- slides sideways but no further out. It is a short leash on purpose: the drift
-- is what the stick does when the thumb has already gone somewhere it should
-- not have to, so the room it is given is a concession and not a feature.
--
-- Nor may it drift out to an edge. STICK_MARGIN is clearance the ring keeps
-- from every side of the safe area wherever it has got to, not just where it
-- rests, because a ring against the edge of the screen is a thumb against it
-- with nowhere left to push -- which is the whole complaint this stick is
-- written against, arrived at from the other direction.
--
-- Be honest about what that costs, because it is the one thing here that costs
-- anything. A reversal answers once the thumb is back inside the throw, so
-- while the ring is keeping up it is 23px of travel however far you have gone
-- -- and past the leash it is that plus everything you went over by, paid back
-- before the stick will turn. There is no arrangement without that bill: the
-- distance a reversal costs *is* the distance from the thumb to the origin, and
-- the distance the ring has wandered is the rest of the way to the thumb, so
-- the two only trade against each other. A leash buys the second with the
-- first, and it is the right way round because the wander is unbounded and
-- silent while the lag is bounded, self-correcting and only ever felt where the
-- thumb is somewhere it cannot play from anyway.
--
-- Which is why the other two are the real fix, and both remove the reason to
-- push out at all rather than managing what happens when you do: the throw is
-- set against a thumb (full tilt is the knob's edge touching the rim, and the
-- ring is sized so that lands about a centimetre out, where it used to be four
-- millimetres), and there is no speed above full tilt, so the ring says so in
-- red rather than letting a thumb push on for something that is not there.
--
-- Everything here is reported in canvas pixels, never window pixels, so the
-- rest of the game never has to think about the display scale.
