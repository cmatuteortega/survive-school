-- What the book remembers about a lesson.
--
-- A run leaves nothing behind it. The page is infinite and thrown away, the
-- marks fade, and the loadout dies with the player -- which is right for a run
-- and wrong for a *book*: seven lessons you have never told apart look
-- identical from the timetable, and the only thing that can tell them apart
-- before you have played them is what you did on them last time.
--
-- So one line per subject is kept, and it is three numbers rather than a table of
-- them: how long the longest run on that page lasted, how many it killed, and how
-- many times one run on it has put that lesson's boss down -- all three of them
-- things the run is already counting (`game.time`, `game.kills`, `game.eyes`), and
-- the first two the pair the win card prints. Nothing else here is worth keeping
-- score of, because nothing else is a thing you can beat.
--
-- The third is called `bosses` here and `eyes` in the run, and the difference is
-- deliberate. The eye is the only boss anybody has drawn yet and every lesson
-- fights it; each lesson is getting its own. A run may name what it is fighting,
-- because a run only ever fights one thing -- but this file outlives seven of
-- them, and a column called `eyes` would be a column that went quietly wrong on
-- the day maths grew a boss of its own.
--
-- The third one was added for a second reader. This file used to be read by one
-- screen -- the timetable's two stat rows -- and it is now also what says which
-- parts of the catalogue the book has opened at all (src/collection.lua), which is
-- the one thing here worth knowing before changing it: a quest is written
-- against these numbers, so a number that stopped being kept is a shelf of the
-- library that can never be filled in.
--
-- **And a fourth field that is not a number of anything: the course the best run
-- was sat at** (src/course.lua). A best of 8:31 means one thing on a page you sat
-- at high school and another on the page you sat at a doctorate, so a register
-- that kept the first without the second would have forgotten the harder half of
-- what you did -- which is the whole reason the ladder is a thing the book
-- remembers rather than a private multiplier.
--
-- It is a **label on the time and not a record of its own**, and that is the one
-- place this file bends its own rule, so it is worth being exact about. The three
-- numbers are maxima and cannot go down. This moves with `time` and only with
-- `time`: beat your best on the easiest course in the book and the register says
-- so, in both columns, because the alternative is a line reading 8:31 at a
-- doctorate about a run that was nothing of the kind. Which is safe precisely
-- because nothing gates on it -- the collection asks this file for times, kills,
-- bosses and counts of pages clearing a bar, and never once for a course. A field
-- that can go down may exist here as long as no unlock is written against it, and
-- if one ever is, this is the field that has to change first.
--
-- **And a fifth that is the course again, kept the honest way: `won`, the hardest
-- class this lesson's boss has ever been put down at.** It is the one thing above
-- that a gate *is* written against (COMPLETE EVERY CLASS AT MASTERS, on the
-- homework list -- src/challenges.lua), which is exactly why it cannot be the
-- field above it. So it is a maximum on the ladder's own order and nothing else:
-- it moves only upwards, it moves only when a boss actually goes down, and it
-- knows nothing about the clock beside it. Beat art at a doctorate and then spend
-- a fortnight beating it at high school and the register still says doctorate,
-- because you still did it.
--
-- Two fields naming a course and one meaning: a page you played, and a page you
-- won. Neither is derivable from the other -- the longest run on a page need not
-- be the one that shut the eye -- which is the whole reason there are two.
--
-- A record is a **maximum**, never a last-run or an average. A page you have
-- played once is a page you have a best on, and a bad run must not be able to
-- take something away from you -- which is also why every route out of a run
-- banks (`Game:bankRun`): dying, winning and walking out of the pause card are
-- all the same fact, that this is how far the run got.
--
-- That is also the whole reason the collection is keyed to this file and has none
-- of its own: an unlock read off a maximum can never be taken away, so there is
-- nothing to save and nothing to keep in step. The boss count is a maximum on the
-- same terms -- the most bosses *one* run on that page put down, not a tally of
-- them -- which is what keeps it a record rather than a meter. And it is what
-- makes the two counts below (`Records.sat`, `best.beat`) safe to gate on: a count
-- of pages whose maximum clears a bar is itself a thing that can only go up.
--
-- The file is written the way a design is (src/design.lua): plain text in the
-- save directory, one record a line, and a line that has been edited into
-- something the game cannot read is skipped rather than trusted -- a bad line
-- costs you that lesson's record and nothing else.

-- was counting the term twice.
--
