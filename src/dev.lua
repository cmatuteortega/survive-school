-- DEV ONLY: this module does not ship. An override rather than an edit, which
-- is why it is safe to leave in while the game is made -- it writes nothing.
-- `Collection.has`, `Collection.lessonOpen` and `Characters.owns` ask
-- `Dev.opened` before they ask the register, so stepping back to EARNED
-- restores exactly what the book remembers. Three states because ALL (a
-- finished book, for balancing a late run) and NONE (the first afternoon, on a
-- save full of records) are not opposites. The purse and the perks bought out
-- of it are deliberately untouched: those are purchases, and src/refund.lua is
-- their way back. Nothing is on the page until the word SETTINGS is tapped
-- three times (`Dev.showing`).
--
-- It also decides, once at load, whether the shop and the ads get desktop
-- stand-ins (src/store.lua, src/ads.lua): love-iap's mock store and an ad that
-- pays after a second, so the shop and both ad offers can be played through
-- without a phone. On a phone the real bridges win regardless.
--
-- TAKING IT OUT AT LAUNCH is three calls, two guards and a file: the last row
-- of `ROWS` in src/settings.lua, the `Dev.opened` calls in `Collection.has`,
-- `Collection.lessonOpen` and `Characters.owns`, the `unlocks` and `dev` lines
-- src/options.lua writes, the `Dev.showing` guards in src/pause.lua and
-- src/game.lua's `keypressed`, the `Dev.showing()` that picks the stand-ins in
-- src/store.lua and src/ads.lua, the BOSS button in src/menu.lua and the
-- `Dev.boss` read in src/game.lua (`Game:reset`, `Game:bankRun`,
-- `Game:cashRun`, and the menu's "boss" answer) -- and then this file.

local Dev = {}

-- The order the settings row steps in; EARNED first, the shipping answer.
Dev.MODES = { "earned", "all", "none" }

-- Stepped on the settings page and saved with the rest (src/options.lua); a
-- file naming a state this build lacks keeps this default, like every option.
Dev.unlocks = "earned"

-- Whether any of it is on the page. Saved too (src/options.lua), so the gesture
-- is done once; off on a book nobody has done it on.
Dev.shown = false

-- Asked by the two screens before they draw any of it. Not simply `Dev.shown`:
-- a book left in ALL with the row put away would be lying with no visible way
-- back, so being off the shipping answer shows the controls regardless. That
-- also covers an older options file with an `unlocks` line and no `dev` line.
function Dev.showing()
    return Dev.shown or Dev.unlocks ~= "earned"
end

-- The boss test, thrown by the BOSS button in the title's bottom-right corner
-- (src/menu.lua), which is only drawn while `Dev.showing`. While it is on, the
-- timetable's GO! does not start a run, it starts the lesson's boss fight: the
-- run is built as usual and the boss is sent on the first frame
-- (`Game:reset`), so a boss can be iterated on without ten minutes of horde in
-- front of every look at it. Which boss walks on is the lesson's `boss`
-- (src/subjects.lua), which is the point -- pick the page on the timetable and
-- that page's boss is what you get.
--
-- A run sat this way is not the book's business: it writes no record, no
-- tally, no coins and no bookmark (`Game:bankRun`, `Game:cashRun`), since a
-- boss fought at level one with a borrowed loadout is not a run anybody played.
-- The pause card's T and W switches are what to lend it.
--
-- Not saved. It is on from the button to the next YES or CONTINUE on the title,
-- so RETRY on the death card is another go at the same boss, and a launch never
-- opens in it.
Dev.boss = false

-- The one question the three readers ask. On EARNED it hands the register's own
-- answer straight back.
