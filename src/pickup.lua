-- What the page scatters for you to walk to. Three kinds -- a heart that heals,
-- a droplet that makes drawing free for a moment, a diamond worth a whole
-- level -- and all
-- of them land out of view, because the reward is the walk: a gem is thrown at
-- your feet by a kill you already made, and these are the opposite half of that
-- idea, something out there that pays a run for moving instead of standing in
-- one spot grinding the horde. That is also why the magnet ignores them and
-- there is no pull at all -- touched means touched.
--
-- They arrive two ways. A scatter clock drops one just past the screen edge
-- every few seconds, so there is always something a few steps from view -- and
-- underneath that, the page itself has pickups at fixed spots, a pure function
-- of the cell coordinates like the ruling and everything else about the page
-- (see src/background.lua on determinism). A fixed spot materialises when you
-- come near, is still there if you leave and come back, and once taken is gone
-- for the run: it is a place on the page, not a beat on a clock, and knowing
-- where one is is worth something.
--
-- And a fourth that is never scattered and never on the fixed layer: the coin
-- the piggy bank puts on the page (src/piggyboss.lua), as bait in its charge
-- lanes and as what bursts out of it. It is here rather than in its brain
-- because it is the same thing as the other three -- touched means taken, and
-- it stays on the page when the fight is over.
