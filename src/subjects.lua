-- Which page of the book the run is played on, and what it is played with.
--
-- The game is a notebook, and a notebook has more than one subject in it. A
-- subject is a *page* -- how it is ruled -- and a *tool* -- the one thing the run
-- opens holding. Both are picked in the same breath, on the timetable
-- (src/timetable.lua), because they are the same decision: you are choosing which
-- part of the book to open, and a lesson is what you brought to it.
--
-- The page is the bigger half of that, and not only because it is the half you
-- can see. Every mark in this game is read against the ruling it crosses
-- (src/overprint.lua): ink laid over a printed line comes out a step darker than
-- the same ink laid on blank paper. Squared paper, ruled both ways, darkens a
-- stroke about twice as often as ruled paper does; the unruled page has next to
-- nothing to darken against, so a run on it is drawn very nearly in the colours
-- the tools say they are and nothing else. None of that had to be written -- it
-- falls out of the overprint pass -- which is why a page is allowed to be
-- nothing but ruling and is still a different game to look at.
--
-- All seven have something vertical on them a page width apart, and it is one
-- decision rather than seven. Horizontal ruling cannot tell you that you are
-- moving: the sheet is infinite, and every line coming up the screen looks like
-- the one it replaced. Something that goes past once a page can -- which the
-- ruled page's margin was already doing and the rest were not, so the staves got
-- bar lines, the grid a doubled rule of its own, the calendar its week line, the
-- spreadsheet its filled header column, and the unruled page the only furniture
-- a page with no ruling is allowed, which is its punch holes.
--
-- **The crowd is the same at every lesson; the shape it arrives in is not.**
-- Every subject spawns from the same table, with the same monsters unlocking at
-- the same minutes and worth the same health when they do (`TABLE` and
-- `Spawner:scale` in src/spawner.lua), and none of them turns either of the two
-- dials that would change that -- `crowd`, which multiplies the weight of a
-- kind, and `clock`, which scales the difficulty clock. Both are still read
-- defensively by the spawner, because a lesson that wants to lean on the horde
-- is a thing this game should be able to say; nothing says it yet.
--
-- What *does* say it is the other axis, and the split between the two is the one
-- thing worth knowing before turning either dial here: **a page may shape an
-- arrival and may never price one; a course prices every arrival and cannot
-- shape a single one** (src/course.lua). A harder crowd is a course, which is
-- why it is bought rather than picked and why the register files it against the
-- page. Anything on this row that made a lesson *harder* rather than different
-- would be a lesson whose record could not be compared to any other lesson's,
-- which is the whole thing the narrowness above is protecting.
--
-- What every subject *does* say is its `drills`: which of the five formations
-- the page may deal and how often it deals one (`DRILLS` in src/spawner.lua).
-- That is a third dial and it is deliberately a weaker one, because it can only
-- move where a monster is standing when you notice it -- never what the monster
-- is or what it costs to kill. A page may shape an arrival; it may never price
-- one. So two lessons are different games to play while staying the same game to
-- measure, which is what makes a record on one worth comparing to a record on
-- another (src/records.lua), and it is why the drill weights below are argued
-- from the ruling rather than from difficulty: a page deals the shapes its own
-- lines already suggest.
--
-- Between them, the page, the tool and the drills are enough to make two runs
-- different games: one decides what every mark comes out as, the second decides
-- what the marks are, and the third decides what you are drawing them at.
--
-- **The order of the list below is the term.** It used to be an order to read
-- them in and nothing else; it is now the one thing about this file another
-- module is written against, because a lesson is opened by the lesson *above*
-- it (`Collection.rungs` in src/collection.lua, and see the note over the list).
-- Moving a row moves the ladder, and the tabs down the edge of the timetable are
-- this list in this order for exactly that reason -- what a column of tabs is,
-- once the book opens at one page and works down, is the ladder drawn.

local Palette = require("src.palette")

local Subjects = {}

-- A page is baked into a repeating tile once at load (src/background.lua), so a
-- ruling is written as a pure function of where you are inside that tile. Two
-- rules, and both of them show up as a seam down the page if they are broken:
-- `w` and `h` have to be whole multiples of whatever the ruling repeats on, and
-- `at` may only answer with one of the surfaces the overprint lookup knows about
-- (`Palette.surfaces`) -- and for a *ruling* that means three of them: blank
-- paper, a ruled line, or the margin. A colour on the page outside that list is
-- a colour the pass has to guess at.
--
-- There is a fourth surface, and it is not for use here: graphite is the *paper*
-- of the half a page the scissors' last level lifts off (src/scissors.lua). What
-- a cut takes away is the paper and not the printing on it, so the offcut is this
-- same spec baked a second time with every `Palette.paper` answer swapped for
-- graphite (`Background.torn`) -- the ruling below is untouched by it and needs
-- to know nothing about it. A lesson ruled in graphite would be a lesson played
-- on a permanently severed page.

-- The page this game was drawn on: 2px of blue every 10, and a blush margin
-- every 192 -- one page width. Where the two cross, the rule wins; a margin that
-- broke every ruled line would read as a dotted column rather than as the line
-- down the side of a page.

-- The same ruling with every third line left out, so it comes in pairs: line,
-- line, gap. It repeats on 30 rather than on 10, and the tile is four groups
-- tall.
--
-- What that buys is the one thing an even ruling cannot give you, and it is the
-- same thing the vertical marks below are for: an even field of lines looks
-- identical however far up it you are, and a page of pairs does not. A stroke
-- drawn down this page crosses two rules and then twenty pixels of nothing, so
-- where it starts inside the group changes how it comes out -- a smaller version
-- of what the staves do, on a page that still reads as ordinary ruled paper.
local GROUPED = {

-- Ruled paper with the verticals added, which is what squared paper is. One
-- pixel rather than two: at the same 10px pitch a 2px grid is a fifth of the
-- page painted blue, and the page has to stay the thing everything else is read
-- against.
--
-- The margin is the same idea as the ruled page's, in the grid's own colour
-- rather than in blush -- squared paper is printed in one ink, and a red line
-- here would be a second thing on a page that already has two directions of
-- ruling on it. What marks it out as a margin instead of another grid line is
-- that it is *double*, the way the horizontal rules on the ruled page are, so
-- it reads as heavier than the line 4px away from it rather than as a colour of
-- its own. It sits at the same x as the ruled page's margin and repeats on the
-- tile, i.e. once a page width, and it falls between two grid lines rather than
-- on one so neither is thickened by it.

-- A calendar: day boxes 32 across and 24 down, ruled 2px along the top of every
-- row and 1px down every column. The weights are the difference between this and
-- squared paper and are worth keeping -- a calendar is a stack of week strips
-- with the days divided off inside them, not an even lattice, and printing the
-- horizontals heavier is what says which of the two directions is the row.
--
-- The blush rule is the week boundary, and it is exactly the ruled page's margin
-- doing a second job: one pixel of blush once a tile, on a line the grid was
-- drawing anyway, so it costs the page nothing and is the thing that goes past
-- you. The row rules are tested first so they win the crossing, for the reason
-- they win it on the ruled page.

-- A spreadsheet: cells 40 across and 12 down -- wide and short, which is what
-- makes a grid read as a sheet of figures rather than as squared paper -- with
-- the lettered header band along the top and the numbered header column down the
-- side filled solid.
--
-- The two filled bands are the page's whole idea, and they are also the only
-- place in any of the seven pages where a *solid* area of ruling is printed. That
-- is what a header is, and the overprint pass makes it worth more than a look:
-- ink laid inside one comes out a step darker the way it does over a line, but
-- across a block instead of at a crossing, so the header is a strip of page where
-- everything you draw is heavier. Between them they are about a tenth of the
-- sheet, which is what keeps them a feature of it rather than a second surface to
-- play on.
--
-- The cells start where the headers end and the tile has to close on both: `w`
-- is 10 + 5 cells of 40 and `h` is 8 + 10 rows of 12, so the rule at the far edge
-- of the last cell is the next tile's header rather than a doubled line.
local LEDGER = {

-- Staves: five lines four apart, then a gap the same height again before the
-- next one. It repeats on 40, and the tile is three of them tall.
--
-- The gap is the point. Ruled paper is an even field and squared paper is an
-- even grid, so on both of them the ruling under a mark is roughly the same
-- wherever the mark is; here it comes in bands, and a stroke drawn across a
-- stave darkens five times in seventeen pixels and then not at all for the next
-- twenty. It is the one page where where you draw changes how the drawing comes
-- out.
--
-- The bar lines are what the page has instead of a margin, on the same spacing
-- as the ruled page's -- once a tile, which is once a page width. They only
-- cross the stave rather than running the height of the tile, because that is
-- what a bar line is: the gap between two staves is the gap between two systems
-- and nothing is written in it. Three of them go past per tile rather than one,
-- so the page reads as moving under you the way the horizontal rules cannot.

-- Unruled, which is a real page in a real notebook and is very nearly the

-- on this page stays the exact colour its tool says it is nearly everywhere it
-- is put. The run is quieter to look at and harder to read a distance off, since
-- the ruling is what a sprite is normally sized against.
--
-- The `nearly` is the punch holes, and they are the whole of what is printed
-- here. A page with no ruling at all has nothing on it that passes you: walking
-- across it is walking on the same pixel, and the one page you draw on freely is
-- the one that never tells you you are moving. Two holes a tile down the same
-- column the other pages keep their margin in is the least that fixes that -- a
-- thing the eye can count going by, on a page that otherwise gives it nothing --
-- and it is sparse enough that the control case survives it: a mark has to be
-- laid across one of these rings to come out a step darker, and almost none are.
--
-- The first one sits high in the tile rather than in the middle of it, and that
-- is for the timetable rather than for the run: a swatch is read from the tile's
-- own origin and is around twenty rows deep (src/timetable.lua), so a hole any
-- lower down would leave this subject's card showing a blank rectangle and no
-- account at all of what its page is. Where a tile repeats forever the phase is
-- free, so it may as well be the phase the card can see.

-- A subject is a page, a tool and a hand of drills: the ruling the run is played
-- on, the one thing it is handed to draw with, and which of the five formations
-- the horde may arrive in. Every one of them draws from the same spawn table
-- with the same unlock times and the same health curve, so the crowd that turns
-- up to a lesson is the crowd that turns up to all of them -- what a subject
-- changes is what you are looking at, what is in your hand, and where the crowd
-- is standing when you look up.
--
-- The tool names a line in src/upgrades.lua rather than a row in src/tools.lua,
-- because a tool line's *first level is its unlock*: handing a run a tool is
-- taking that line to level one, which is why it costs one of the four tool
-- slots exactly as a drafted tool does. `Loadout.new` takes it before the run is
-- built.
--
-- Seven subjects and ten tools, so three are missing. Two of them are the same
-- refusal: the pen and the gluestick are what you draw to keep something *out*,
-- and a run that opened holding one would be defending before it had anything to
-- defend. They are drafted rather than issued until there is a lesson that is
-- about holding a line. The scissors are out for a different reason -- they are
-- the one tool on the strip you have to be *told* how to use, since every other
-- one does something on the first press and a cut waits for the second -- so a
-- run is not handed them before it has read the card.
--
-- SCIENCE is first because first is the default: it is the page the title screen
-- stands on before anything has been picked, the plain ruling this game was
-- drawn on, and the pencil every other number in the game is written against.
-- It is also the one lesson a fresh book may sit, since the rest are opened by
-- the one above them -- so first here is first in the term as well as first in
-- the column.
--
-- **The rest are in the order the book opens them**, which is the order they get
-- harder to be handed and the order the pages get further from the one this game
-- was drawn on. P.E. is second because the calendar is the plainest page after
-- the ruled one and the stapler is the plainest tool after the pencil -- a wall
-- you put down and walk away from. GRAMMAR and FINANCE are the two pages that are
-- ruled *more*, and the highlighter and the ruler are the two tools that ask you
-- to draw a considered line rather than a quick one. MUSIC, MATHS and ART are the
-- back of the book: the three pages that look least like paper you write on, and
-- the pushpin, the compass and the rubber, which are the three tools that do
-- something the rest of the strip does not do at all.
--
-- And each lesson names its **boss**: the `Enemy.types` row that walks into the
-- box at the end of every cycle (`Spawner:sendBoss`). P.E. has a fight of its
-- own, the whistle, GRAMMAR has the dictionary, MUSIC the metronome, FINANCE
-- the stamp, MATHS the die and ART the still life; SCIENCE keeps the eye,
-- written out on its row rather than left to the fallback so that giving a
-- page a fight of its own is one word on its own row. A new boss is a row in src/enemy.lua with
-- `boss = true` on it; the dev boss test on the title screen (src/dev.lua) is
-- how to fight it without the ten minutes in front of it.
