-- The settings page: how loud the game is, what language it is in, which way up
-- the page is held, which thumb walks, how much of a hit it says out loud,
-- whether a hit buzzes the phone, and whether it asks you to draw the things it
-- hands you.
--
-- **Nothing on this page is a question, so nothing on it is a box you scribble
-- in.** That is the same rule the timetable's tabs and the whole of the library
-- are drawn along, and it holds harder here than in either of them. A box
-- (src/scribble.lua) is a thing you cannot take back -- it arms while you draw in
-- it, it warms slate to red, and lifting commits it -- and every one of those
-- properties is wrong for a volume. A volume is not an answer you could get
-- wrong; it is a quantity, you can always move it again, and the only way to know
-- whether it is right is to *hear* it. So a bar is dragged, an arrow is pressed,
-- and the corner button closes the page -- and ink that lands anywhere else is
-- still ink and still fades off, because the page is a page.
--
-- It follows the pause card's shape rather than the library's -- one fixed block
-- of rows, centred in the safe area, a heading over it and a hint under it --
-- because it *can*: eight rows are eight rows on every screen and in every
-- language, so there is a block here of a height that is always the same, which
-- is the one thing the library never has. The dev row is the one thing that
-- changes that count and it is not a counter-example: it is on the page only
-- once the heading has been tapped three times (src/dev.lua), so a block that
-- grew is a block you asked for rather than one that twitched under you. What it does not borrow is the card.
-- The pause card is paper because there is a run underneath it that lettering
-- cannot be read against; here there is nothing underneath but the page you came
-- in on, so this is written straight onto it, the way the timetable and the
-- library are.
--
-- The bars themselves are the exception and go out past the overprint pass with
-- the corner button, for the timetable's tab reason: a paper-filled box still has
-- every inked pixel of its border paired with the page under it, so a border
-- landing on a rule comes out a step darker and the box reads as a hole rather
-- than as a thing lying on the page. The number beside a bar goes out with it --
-- the bar and what it says are one object -- while the labels, the heading and
-- the hint are lettering and stay on the page.
--
-- The two stepped rows are the library's footer arrows doing the library's job:
-- two boxes either side of the name of the thing they step. A language's own name
-- for itself is what is written between them (src/i18n.lua), because someone
-- looking for Spanish is looking for the word ESPANOL; the drawings row steps
-- between two words that say what happens rather than between ON and OFF, since
-- ON against a row worded as a refusal is a double negative you have to stop and
-- work out. Both rows' arrows are struck off the widest word either of them can
-- hold, so they line up with each other as well as standing still while their own
-- word is stepped.
--
-- What is set here is saved by src/options.lua, and saved when a drag *ends*
-- rather than while it is happening: a file written on every frame of a drag is a
-- file written sixty times to say one thing.
