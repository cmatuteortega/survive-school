-- What the book has done, added up.
--
-- This is src/records.lua read the other way round, and the two are deliberately
-- separate files rather than more columns on one. A **record** is a maximum kept
-- per lesson -- the longest run, the biggest body count -- and the whole of what
-- makes it safe is that it cannot go down and cannot be paid twice: submit it
-- from every route out of a run and the answer is the same. A **tally** adds up.
-- It is the purse's kind of number (src/purse.lua) rather than the register's,
-- and everything awkward about this file comes from that one difference: a tally
-- banked twice for the same kills is kills made out of nothing.
--
-- So why keep any at all, when the collection's seventeen quests never needed
-- one? Because the homework page stopped asking what your *best* run did and
-- started asking what you have *done* (src/challenges.lua). FIFTY THOUSAND BLOBS
-- is not a thing any one run will ever say -- it is four hundred afternoons -- and
-- there is no maximum anywhere that adds up to it. A book that only remembers its
-- best page can only ever ask you to have a better one.
--
-- **Three things are counted and they are the three a run finishes holding** (and
-- a fourth that is not banked at all -- which bosses the book has met and beaten,
-- see `Tally.met`):
--
-- - `kills[kind]` -- one body count per row of `Enemy.types`, because a homework
--   list that asked for fifty thousand of *anything* would be one challenge with
--   ten prices and a run would learn to farm the page that pays fastest. Keyed by
--   the spawner's own name for the monster, so a new row in src/enemy.lua brings
--   its own counter with it and there is no list here to keep in step.
-- - `bosses` -- how many have been put down, ever. The register keeps the most one
--   run managed; this keeps every one of them.
-- - `time` -- how long the book has been played, in seconds, across every page and
--   every run. The one number in the game that is about the player rather than
--   about anything they did.
--
-- **How it is kept honest: a watermark, not a hook.** Nothing here is called when
-- something dies. The run counts what it counts, exactly as it always has, and
-- `Game:bankTally` hands over the *difference* between what the run holds now and
-- what it has already banked (`Game.tallied`). Every number a run counts only ever
-- goes up, so a difference is always the work done since the last bank -- which
-- makes this as safe to call as `Game:bankRun` beside it: twice in a row adds
-- nothing, walking out through the pause card and coming back adds the second half
-- only, and a bookmarked run resumed on the next launch starts with its watermark
-- set to what it had already paid in (`Game:openBookmark`).
--
-- That is the whole of why the awkwardness is here rather than in the run: one
-- function, called from the one place a run already tells the book what it did,
-- and no weapon, no monster and no screen knows this file exists.
--
-- The file is written the way a record, a purse and a design are: plain text in
-- the save directory, one key and one number a line, and a line the game cannot
-- read costs that one counter and nothing else.
