-- How hard the book is, and what it is called when it is harder.
--
-- Every other axis this game has is *sideways*. A lesson changes what the page
-- is ruled with and what is in your hand (src/subjects.lua) but deliberately
-- never what the crowd costs -- "a page may shape an arrival; it may never price
-- one" -- because that is what keeps a record on one page worth comparing to a
-- record on another. A hero changes who walks out there (src/characters.lua). A
-- perk changes what a draft may be asked (src/perks.lua). None of them makes the
-- run *harder*, and after a dozen afternoons that is the thing the book has run
-- out of ways to be: you have beaten the eye on seven pages and the eighth is the
-- same eye.
--
-- So this is the one dial that is allowed to price the crowd, and it is a
-- **course**: which class you are sitting the lesson as. High school is the game
-- as it was drawn and the game a fresh book plays; a bachelor's, a master's and a
-- doctorate are the same seven lessons read at a level that expects more of you.
-- The metaphor is doing real work rather than decorating a number -- a harder
-- difficulty in most games is a modifier you switch on, and a *course* is
-- something you enrol in, pay for, and are afterwards said to have sat. All three
-- of those turn out to be things this book already knows how to do.
--
-- **It is bought, not unlocked**, which is the one decision here worth being firm
-- about. Everything the collection opens is opened by *playing* (src/collection.
-- lua): a lesson by the lesson above it, a line by a milestone. A harder book
-- cannot work that way, because the milestone it would have to ask for is "beat
-- the game", and a player who has beaten the game and is told to beat it again
-- before the book will get harder has been told the wrong thing. So it is on the
-- counter (src/canteen.lua) beside the perks and the heroes: a level of this line
-- is one more course open, coins are the whole of what it asks, and
-- src/refund.lua hands it back like everything else there. It is also why nothing
-- here goes through src/dev.lua -- a course is a thing you bought, not a thing the
-- book opened, which is exactly the line that file draws around the purse.
--
-- **The dials, and why they are these dials.** A course is spent almost entirely
-- on the two things that were already the difficulty ramp, turned up:
--
-- - `clock` multiplies the difficulty clock, which is the one dial a *subject*
--   was always allowed and no subject has ever turned (`Spawner:update`). It is
--   how many bodies there are: the floor, the wave interval and the batch all
--   read that clock, so a course leans on the whole tap at once and never on one
--   knob of it.
-- - `hp` and `ramp` are the health curve: a flat multiplier on everything, and a
--   steepening of the 15%-a-minute compounding underneath it (`HP_PER_MINUTE`).
--   Two numbers rather than one because they say different things -- `hp` is how
--   tough the horde is when it walks on and `ramp` is how fast that gets away
--   from you, and a course that only had the first would be a course whose tenth
--   minute felt like high school's.
-- - `speed` is the one genuinely new thing a course does to a monster, and it is
--   kept small on purpose. A blob walks 20px a second against a player who walks
--   faster than that, and the whole of the horde's counterplay is that you can
--   *leave*; 12% at a doctorate is the difference between walking away
--   comfortably and walking away, which is a different game to play without being
--   a different game to learn.
--
--   It is the one dial here that the run now turns as well (SPEED_MOST in
--   src/spawner.lua): the minute multiplies this rather than replacing it, so
--   what the class buys is still 4% a rung at every minute of the run, and the
--   ceiling that keeps the horde under the player is on the run's half of the
--   product rather than on the whole of it. A ceiling on the whole of it would
--   read as the same design and quietly delete this row -- every class would
--   arrive at the same top speed, a doctorate merely sooner.
-- - `elite` and `blown` are the two facts about an *arrival* (`Spawner:elite`,
--   `BLOWN_RISE`): more of the crowd is worth turning towards, and the enormous
--   one is overdue sooner. Neither adds anything new -- both lean on a curve the
--   spawner already computes -- but they lean on it in two different places, and
--   which place is the whole content of the pair.
--
--   **`elite` shortens the climb and must never lift the ceiling.** ELITE_MOST's
--   one-in-seven is priced against what a champion *costs the page*: the mark is
--   the body drawn at twice the size (ELITE_GROW), so a seventh of the horde at
--   four times the paper is already most of what the page can carry, and the note
--   over that constant says out loud that past it a double body stops meaning
--   "that one". A course may buy a harder run and may not buy its way past that.
--   So the dial divides ELITE_RAMP instead: a doctorate reaches the same ceiling
--   in half the time, capped by minute seven and a half rather than minute eleven,
--   which measures out over a cycle as a champion in every 40 arrivals against
--   high school's one in 59 -- half again as many double bodies on the page.
--   Which is the honest shape for it anyway -- an endless run sits on the ceiling
--   whatever course it is, so the only thing there was left to sell is the middle
--   of a run, and the middle of a run is what the ten minutes this game is built
--   around *is*.
--
--   **`blown` is tuned against how many you meet, and that had to be measured.**
--   Both dials are read once per arrival and a harder course hands you fewer
--   arrivals -- a doctorate's horde takes over twice as long to clear -- so a
--   chance-per-arrival multiplied by two against an arrival count halved is a
--   course that meets no more of them than the easy one. Which is exactly what the
--   first pass at this measured. A blow-up is an *event*, a handful in a whole
--   run, so the unit that matters is the count and not the fraction, and 3, 9 and
--   30 look wildly out of scale with the rest of the table without being it: a
--   blow-up is metered rather than rolled (the chance climbs at every arrival
--   until one lands, `Spawner:blown`), so how far apart they are goes as the
--   *square root* of the rise -- four times the rise is twice as often -- and then
--   the falling arrival count takes most of that back. Measured over one cycle at
--   a fixed damage-per-second they come out at 1.24, 1.48 and 1.62 times as many
--   blow-ups as high school -- against arrival counts of 76%, 61% and 46% of its.
--
--   Past about there, BLOWN_MOST starts answering instead of the rise and a
--   bigger number stops buying anything. That is the ceiling doing the job it is
--   there for, and it is the same restraint `elite` is under, arrived at from the
--   other side: this dial can never turn the horde into what it is a blow-up of,
--   however hard the course, because the thing it moves is not the ceiling.
-- - `fury` is the third fact about an arrival (`Spawner:fury`) and the one dial
--   in this table that is a *gate* rather than a lean. Everything else here is a
--   multiple of high school, which means every rung of the ladder is the same
--   game with the numbers moved; this is the one thing a doctorate has that the
--   book below it does not have at all -- the same monster gone over in red pen,
--   quicker on its legs and hitting for half again, on exactly the row's health.
--
--   **Zero is how you spell "never" for a meter.** Fury is metered rather than
--   rolled, exactly like a blow-up, so a dial of 0 is a chance that never climbs
--   off the floor and there is no rung named anywhere in src/spawner.lua and no
--   second question asked at a spawn. Which is the shape the rest of this table
--   is in: a class is a row of numbers, and the day fury is worth having a third
--   of the way down the ladder it is one 0 becoming a 20.
--
--   The 60 is the blow-up's own number at the same rung, and deliberately the
--   same: what fury was priced at is *a blow-up's rarity* -- something you meet
--   about once every half minute of a busy page -- so it inherits the whole of
--   the argument above, the falling arrival count and the square root included.
--
--   It is also the one thing in this file that touches what a hit costs you, and
--   the note below still holds: what that forbids is a class quietly repricing a
--   blob, and this reprices one arrival that is wearing red while it does it.
-- - `bosses` is how many of a lesson's bosses stand between the run and the win
--   card (`Spawner:lineup`), and the second gate on this ladder after `fury`. A
--   lesson ends on its boss at high school and a bachelor's; at a master's and a
--   doctorate the boss going down is the end of the first ten minutes rather than
--   of the lesson, and the lesson's *second* boss (`encore` on its row in
--   src/subjects.lua) walks on ten minutes after that. Two rather than "harder",
--   for the reason fury is a gate: what the top of the ladder has run out of is
--   not numbers, it is fights, and a doctorate that is the same eye with more
--   health is the eighth eye the note at the top of this file is about. A lesson
--   that has no second boss yet ends on its first at every rung -- the dial asks
--   for one, it does not invent one.
-- - `pay` is the other side of the bargain and the reason anybody enrols
--   (`Purse.forRun`): a doctorate pays three times what high school does, so the
--   counter it was bought over is also what it is spent on.
--
-- **What a course deliberately does not touch is what a hit costs you.** Enemy
-- damage stays exactly where src/enemy.lua wrote it, and that is the same
-- restraint the spawner puts on its own ramp -- health may climb continuously
-- because a tougher blob is a longer fight, and damage may not, because a blob
-- that hits for a fraction more is a blob nobody can learn. A course is a step
-- rather than a slope, so it *could* have moved it; it doesn't, and the reason is
-- worth being exact about, because a course changes plenty else that a player has
-- learned. What a harder class may take away is *time*: a blob you could kill in
-- one hit now takes two, a crowd you could outwalk now nearly keeps up. What it
-- may not take away is the arithmetic you count your own page of health in -- the
-- blob's 6 is a quarter of you in every class in the building, and a doctorate
-- that quietly made it a third would be a doctorate you die to for a reason
-- nothing on screen ever said.
--
-- `fury` is the exception that proves that last clause rather than a hole in it.
-- An enraged arrival does hit for half again, and every word of the restraint
-- above survives it because the thing it forbids is the word *quietly*: a
-- doctorate's blob still hits for 6, and the one that hits for 9 is red and black
-- from head to foot, is one arrival in a hundred, and said its own name the first
-- time it walked on. What may not be learned is a number that moved behind you.
--
-- **A run is sat at one course and the register remembers which**
-- (src/records.lua). That is the whole reason the ladder is worth having rather
-- than being a private multiplier: a best of 8:31 means one thing on a page you
-- sat at high school and another on the page you sat at a doctorate, and a
-- register that kept the first number without the second would be a book that had
-- forgotten the harder half of what you did.
--
-- The file is written the way a record, a purse and a roster are: plain text in
-- the save directory, a key and one token a line, and a line the game cannot read
-- costs that line its default. A course file nobody can read is a book that has
-- not enrolled in anything, which is the safe way for it to be wrong.
