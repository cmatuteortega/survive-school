-- The timetable: which page of the book this run is played on.
--
-- It sits between the title screen and the board your character is drawn on,
-- which is the only place it can sit. The subject decides how the page is ruled
-- and the ruling is what the drawing is read against (src/overprint.lua), so
-- picking it after the hero is drawn would mean drawing him against one page and
-- playing him on another.
--
-- **The lessons are index tabs down the edge of the book.** That is the whole
-- arrangement, and it is the one thing on this screen that is not a metaphor:
-- you are choosing where to open a notebook, and the way a notebook offers you
-- that choice is a column of tabs sticking out of its edge. They run off the
-- right of the sheet, one per subject, stacked; the lesson is written on the tab
-- with the icon of the tool it hands you at the outside end; and the tab of the
-- lesson you are on is **pulled out** into the page, the way the one you have a
-- finger in is.
--
-- The rest of the sheet is the run that lesson would be: the heading, what the
-- lesson gives you and what your best run on that page came to, which class you
-- are sitting it as, the character about to walk out there, and two boxes --
-- `CUSTOM` to change him and `GO!` to start: a row at the foot on a wide page,
-- apart on a page held upright (`Timetable:panel`).
--
-- **A tab is pressed, not answered, and that is deliberate.** Everything this
-- game asks you, you answer by drawing (src/scribble.lua) -- but a tab is not a
-- question. It is where the book is open, the same kind of thing as the tool
-- selector down the side of a run: you put your finger on one and the book falls
-- open there, page and all. Nothing is spent and nothing is decided, so nothing
-- needs the ceremony of being drawn. The one question on this screen is `GO!`,
-- and that is a box you scribble in like every other question in the game -- and
-- the only bordered box here, which is what makes it read as the answer you
-- cannot take back.
--
-- Two things about the tabs are load-bearing:
--
-- **A tab is card, so it is opaque.** Every one of them is filled in
-- `Palette.paper`, the one colour that covers what is under it rather than
-- stacking with it, and the whole column is drawn *after* the overprint pass so
-- that nothing on a tab is paired with the page under it either -- the border and
-- the lesson are the flat colour they say they are, the way the draft's cards
-- are. Nothing here is a window: what a tab has to carry is a word and an icon,
-- and a page of squares or staves showing through either of them is a pattern
-- competing with the only two things on the tab worth reading.
--
-- **Picking is not leaving.** A tab selects -- the page under the whole screen
-- turns to that ruling, the panel fills in with that lesson's tool and records --
-- and only `GO!` leaves. Seven tabs that went straight to the drawing board would
-- be seven doors with nothing written on them, and the thing worth writing on
-- them (what the lesson hands you, what you have already done with it) has to be
-- somewhere you can stand and read it.
--
-- **The class you are sitting it as is the last row of that block** -- `<` the
-- course `>` (src/course.lua), in the column the figures are in, right-aligned
-- like all of them -- and where it went took three goes to get right, which is
-- worth writing down because the answer is a fact about this whole layout.
--
-- It was a column of four cards down the left margin first, showing the whole
-- ladder at once, locked rungs and all. That is genuinely more than a stepper
-- says, and it cost fifty pixels of margin -- which on any page narrower than a
-- desktop one is fifty pixels the *sheet* then has to be walked out of. Then it
-- was a stepper in the margin under the corner button, which cost the sheet
-- nothing but sat with the furniture, away from the thing it is about.
--
-- It is a row of the block now because the block is where it belongs: everything
-- in that column is what this run would be, and which class you are sitting it as
-- is exactly that. What made the row affordable is the row of boxes at the foot of
-- the page -- see `Timetable:panel` -- since moving `CUSTOM` down beside `GO!`
-- handed the column twenty-eight pixels back and a stat row costs seven.
--
-- What a stepper cannot say on its own is that there is *more* ladder, so the `>`
-- says it: slate where there is a rung to step onto, **red** where the ladder goes
-- on but has not been paid for -- red being what this book writes a thing you have
-- to go and do something about in -- and graphite at the top of it, where there is
-- nothing further at all.
--
-- **And the left margin is where the things that are not the question go**, all of
-- them pressed rather than scribbled for exactly the reason a tab is: nothing is
-- decided by any of them.
--
-- The **corner button** in the top left is a back arrow in the same box in the
-- same corner the run's pause button uses (src/hud.lua), and it closes the book
-- back to the title. `GO!` spends the screen and `CUSTOM` spends a detour; going
-- back spends nothing, and it is the one way out of here that does not even
-- settle which lesson you were on. Being the same box in the same corner as the
-- pause button is the whole of what says so: it is the button that backs out of
-- wherever you are, and this screen is a place you can be.
--
-- The **tabs in the bottom left** are the parts of the book that are not
-- lessons: the shop (`CANTEEN`, src/canteen.lua) and, under it, the catalogue
-- (`LIBRARY`, src/library.lua) and the list of what the book still wants from you
-- (`HOMEWORK`, src/homework.lua). They are tabs rather than buttons because that is what they are -- the
-- subjects are index tabs down the right edge of the book and these are the tabs
-- off the *other* edge, at the bottom, where the reference section of a school
-- notebook goes. Each one is cut to exactly a lesson tab, and each runs off the
-- left edge the way a lesson tab runs off the right.
--
-- **The column is stacked flush**, every card at the same edge of the sheet and
-- one gap apart: they are the same piece of card in the same place, the way the
-- lesson tabs down the other edge are. What says one card from the next is the
-- gap between them and the word on each, exactly as it is over there -- a column
-- that stepped its cards into the page would be saying they are a stack with an
-- order to it, and these are three doors that have nothing to do with each other.
--
-- **And a padlock at the top of the other edge**, on a book that is not the full
-- game yet (src/store.lua): the corner button's box, standing in the page just
-- inside the top lesson tab -- the top right of the sheet, since the tabs are the
-- book's edge rather than the page's. On a page held upright the tabs hang below
-- a header that has the whole width (`Timetable:layout`), and the padlock goes to
-- the corner over them instead, where the title keeps it. Pressed like everything
-- in the margins, and
-- what it opens is the card that asks (src/fullgame.lua). The lessons it would
-- open say so on their own pages: a shut page's two lines are the full game's
-- two lines until it is bought (`Collection.lessonWhy`).
--
-- The corner button and that column are why the panel is fitted between them
-- rather than against the page: the left margin has something in it top and
-- bottom, and a sheet measured off the edges of the page would start its heading
-- under the button and finish `GO!` behind the cards.

-- The sheet, and every last thing on it is read straight down the middle: the
-- heading, the lesson under it at twice the size of anything else written here,
-- the five rows of what this run would be, the character who would be walking out
-- there, the box that changes him, and `GO!` at the foot of the page.
--
-- That line is the middle of the **screen** -- not the middle of what the tabs
-- left over, which is a different line and reads as being slightly out rather
-- than as being centred. The tabs are off the sheet at their edge, so what they
-- take is margin; the page they leave is still the whole page, and the thing this
-- screen is about goes down the middle of it. Where a narrow page would put a
-- centred block under the tabs, the line steps left by exactly as much as it
-- takes to clear them.
--
-- **The character is in that column and not beside it**, which is the one
-- decision here worth writing down. He used to stand out in the left margin with
-- `CUSTOM` under him, on the argument that he is not what the screen is choosing
-- and so is not what it should be centred on -- and what that actually bought was
-- a hero standing in the margin the tabs are stacked in, a hand span from a
-- column of card, with the sheet reading as two things that had been laid out
-- separately. He is who is going out to whatever the tabs pick, and the order the
-- column reads in says so on its own: what today is, which lesson, how it has
-- gone, which class you are sitting it as, and who is going out there.
--
-- **And the two boxes are both at the foot, out of the column altogether**, which
-- is the newest decision here and the one the rest of this layout now rests on.
-- `CUSTOM` used to sit directly under the character on the argument that it is the
-- door to *him* rather than to the lesson, and `GO!` alone at the very foot on the
-- argument that the one answer which spends the screen should be where nothing
-- else is. Both were true; between them they cost the column twenty-eight pixels
-- out of its middle, which is where the drawing is, and twenty-eight pixels is the
-- difference between the character being drawn at twice the size he is played at
-- and at once. A word under him is a worse way of serving him than a bigger
-- drawing of him. See `Timetable:panel` for the two arrangements the foot has and
-- which page gets which.
--
-- **There are no hint lines above it any more.** The three of them -- what to
-- scribble, which keys pick a tab, which keys answer what -- were a paragraph of
-- instructions sitting in the space the character now stands in, and everything
-- they named is a thing on the page you can press. What is left to say is said by
-- the page itself: a box warms slate to blue to red as it fills, which is how
-- every question in this game says it is being answered.
--
-- Every part of the sheet is still measured at its widest and tallest -- the
-- longest lesson name in the book, the widest tool name, the longest character
-- name, the longest course, every weapon in the roster, all six rows of the block
-- whether or not there is anything to put in them -- so nothing moves as you go
-- down the tabs.
--
-- The character is the one part that can be dropped, and it is height that drops
-- him rather than width, since he is in the column instead of beside it. He goes
-- first because he is the only part that says nothing you cannot read elsewhere:
-- the board two screens on is where you actually deal with him. Nothing has to
-- close up behind him any more -- the boxes are at the foot in both arrangements,
-- so the column simply ends at the stats.
--
-- `top` is the first row the sheet may have and `bottom` the last, and neither
-- is measured off the safe edge: the corner button has the rows above and the
-- column of tabs in the left margin the rows below, and those are the only things
-- on this screen a stroke cannot be drawn over.
--
-- Read in order, this function decides which arrangement the two boxes are in,
-- the middle line, where they actually land, how much height that leaves the
-- column, how big the character can be in it, and how what is left over is spent.
-- Each one needs the last.

    -- **The two boxes are one row at the foot of the page**, `CUSTOM` then `GO!`,
    -- and that is worth the paragraph because it used to be the other way and the
    -- other way was argued for. `GO!` was alone at the foot on the grounds that it
    -- is the one answer that spends the screen, and `CUSTOM` sat directly under
    -- the character on the grounds that it is the door to *him* rather than to the
    -- lesson. Both of those are true and neither was worth what it cost: a box is
    -- twenty pixels deep and it was taking twenty-eight out of the middle of the
    -- column, which is where the drawing of the character is -- and the drawing is
    -- the one thing on this sheet that says anything a word could not. Twenty-eight
    -- pixels is the difference between him being drawn at twice the size he is
    -- played at and at once, on a phone and on a 16:9 page alike.
