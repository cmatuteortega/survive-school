-- Three bitmap faces. LÖVE's default vector font would be enormous inside a
-- 320x180 canvas and would break the pixel grid, so everything with lettering in
-- it uses these instead. Glyphs are stored white and tinted with
-- love.graphics.setColor at draw time.
--
-- The 3x5 face is the quiet one and is what the HUD, the cards and every prompt
-- are written in -- and, since the game is playable in six languages
-- (src/i18n.lua), it is the one face that carries the marks that spell a word in
-- one of them: N-tilde and the two inverted marks, the umlauts, the Portuguese
-- tildes and the cedilla. Those are two bytes each in UTF-8, which is why nothing
-- here counts `#text`: see **walking a string** below. The bold faces are digits and
-- ASCII, because the only thing that shouts is a damage number. The other two are the loud one at two sizes -- `Font.bold` at
-- 5x7 and `Font.boldSmall` at 5x5 -- and they exist for the damage numbers
-- (src/damage.lua), which is why they were digits for a long while. They are the
-- whole ASCII repertoire now: caps, digits and punctuation, so that anything the
-- page wants to *shout* rather than state can be shouted in the same face a hit
-- is announced in, at the same two sizes, with the same outline round it.
--
-- Two things about the bold faces are worth knowing, because both were arrived
-- at the hard way. They are the one piece of lettering in the game that is
-- *outlined*, and a 3x5 glyph with a pixel of ink all the way round it is more
-- outline than glyph -- at that weight the counter of an 8 fills in and a 1
-- comes out a bar, so the alphabet face could not be reused however convenient
-- that would be.
--
-- And the outline is baked into the atlas rather than drawn as offset copies of
-- the glyph, which is how the rest of the game does an outline (Sprites.rim,
-- Enemy:draw's bleach). Two reasons. Copies of a *glyph* offset by a pixel eat
-- one pixel off the pitch at each side, so at any sensible advance the digits of
-- a number fuse into a single dark plate with the figures knocked out of it --
-- readable, but it stops looking like numbers. And a number is up to three
-- glyphs redrawn eight times each: baked, it is one draw per ring per digit,
-- which is what makes a screenful of them free.

-- Every stroke is two pixels thick and every counter is one, which is what lets
-- a glyph keep its shape under an outline drawn a pixel out all the way round it
-- -- and what makes the face read as heavier than the HUD's, which is the point:
-- these are figures that are meant to feel like a thump.
--
-- Five is the narrowest a two-sided digit can be under those rules -- two of
-- stroke, one of counter, two of stroke -- so neither bold face is narrower than
-- the other and a number is the same width whichever one draws it. The letters
-- were then written to that cell rather than the cell to the letters, and three
-- things fall out of it that are worth knowing before editing one:
--
-- **Vertical strokes are two pixels, horizontal bars are one.** That is what the
-- digits already did (a 0 is a full box with a one-pixel counter down it), and a
-- letter that breaks it stops looking like it belongs beside a number.
--
-- **Five columns will not hold three stems**, so M and N cannot draw their
-- diagonals as diagonals: there is exactly one column between the two stems.
-- Both are drawn by moving the *weight* instead -- M fills that column near the
-- top, N walks the fat side from left to right down the glyph and crosses in the
-- middle. That is also why the two are told apart by where the solid rows are
-- rather than by their shape, and why moving one of those rows breaks the pair.
--
-- **A handful of symbols are lattices and are authored at one pixel** -- `#`,
-- `*`, `%`, `&`, `@`, and the apexes of V, X and the arrows. There is no
-- two-pixel drawing of a hash in five columns. They survive because the ring is
-- baked round whatever is there, so a one-pixel stroke still comes out as a
-- figure held off the page; they are simply lighter than the rest of the face,
-- which is the right way round for punctuation.
--
-- **A curve is a cut corner.** B, D, P and R lose the last column of their bars
-- and C, G, J, O, Q, S and U lose the first and last pixel of theirs. That is
-- the only shape of curve five columns will hold, and it is load-bearing rather
-- than decorative: the digits are square-cornered and cannot move (their pixels
-- are documented in README.md), so without it O would be exactly 0, S exactly 5
-- and G one row away from 6. Squaring any of those seven letters back up puts a
-- collision into a face that now has to spell words next to numbers.

-- The same rules two rows shorter: one counter row instead of two. Drawn a pixel
-- taller than the HUD's lettering and a pixel shorter than a blob, which is the
-- whole reason it exists -- the tier that uses it is chip damage, and a number
-- that stands taller than the monster it came off is not saying "this barely
-- happened".
--
-- 5x5 is the floor of this design and there is nothing under it. An 8 needs
-- three bars with a counter between each pair, so the height can only be 3 + 2c
-- -- 7 with two-pixel counters, 5 with one-pixel ones, and no value in between.
-- Going below would mean one-pixel strokes, which is the alphabet face, which
-- does not survive an outline. The cost is that 5, 6, 8 and 9 now differ by a
-- single row; it holds at this size, but there is no margin left in it.
--
-- All ten digits are authored even though the tier that draws them tops out at 5
-- and so can only ever ask for five of them: a threshold moved in src/damage.lua
-- should change what a number looks like, never make one impossible to draw. The
-- rest of the repertoire is here for the same reason -- the two faces are one
-- face at two sizes, and a caller picking the small one should never find that
-- half of what it wanted to say is missing from it.
--
-- Losing the second counter row is not free and two letters pay for it. M and W
-- have one solid row each here rather than two: at seven rows the pair are told
-- apart by three rows of clear space between where the weight sits, and at five
-- rows two solid rows each would leave them one row apart and reading as the
-- same letter. So the small M fills row 2 and the small W fills row 4, which is
-- the widest the two can be separated at this height -- and H, which is the same
-- two stems joined in the middle, has row 3 to itself between them. Those three
-- rows are the whole of what tells M, H and W apart at this size; move one and
-- two letters become one.

--- the bold faces --------------------------------------------------------------

-- A bold face is a size, not a global: there are two of them and a caller picks
-- one, so everything that used to be a module constant -- the cell, the pitch,
-- the two atlases -- hangs off the face itself.
local Bold = {}
Bold.__index = Bold

-- Baked twice: the glyphs sat in a padded cell, and the ring of pixels one step
-- outside each of them.
--
-- The ring is everything within a step of the glyph that is not the glyph, which
-- includes the counters -- the hole in a 0, both holes in an 8. That is on
-- purpose and it is what makes these faces readable at scale 1: a counter one
-- pixel wide comes out in the ring's colour rather than showing the page
-- through, so a 0 is a light figure with a dark bar down it and never a solid
-- block. It is also why they are authored with two-pixel strokes and one-pixel
-- counters and cannot be redrawn thinner.
--
-- The pitch is a pixel *less* than the cell, so neighbouring cells share the
-- column of padding between them and a two-digit number reads as one figure
-- rather than two things sitting near each other. What separates the digits is
-- then a single pixel of ring rather than a pixel of ring, a pixel of page and a
-- pixel of ring -- which is tight, and tight is what a number wants to be.
--
-- Two facts make that overlap safe and both have to hold. Only padding overlaps:
-- the figures sit in the middle five columns of a seven-wide cell, so at this
-- pitch they still have a clear column between them and nothing of a figure is
-- ever covered. And every ring of a number is drawn before any of its bodies, in
-- one colour (src/damage.lua), so ring landing on ring cannot show.

--- walking a string ----------------------------------------------------------

-- A glyph is not a byte. Nearly every string in the game is plain ASCII and one
-- byte is one letter, but the Spanish alphabet needs an N-tilde and the two
-- inverted marks, and in UTF-8 those are two bytes apiece. Counted by the byte
-- they would each measure as two cells and draw as two blanks -- and because
-- every screen in this game reserves room for the *widest* string it can ever
-- hold, one mis-measured character does not misplace one word, it misplaces the
-- block it was measured for.
--
-- So the three places that walk a string -- the width, the draw and the title
-- animation in src/scribble.lua -- walk glyphs through this, and nothing counts
-- `#text` any more.
--
-- Nothing here allocates: a lead byte says how long its glyph is, so a walk is
-- an index and an addition. That matters because the HUD draws a dozen strings a
-- frame and some of them (the kill count, the clock) are a new string each time,
-- so anything cached per string would grow all run.
