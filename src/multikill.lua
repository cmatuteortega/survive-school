-- The word thrown up when one gesture puts more than a handful of the crowd
-- down at once -- the flourish a whole action earns, next to the number each
-- individual hit already gets (src/damage.lua). Same face, same outlined
-- construction, drawn over the finished page for the same reason a damage
-- number is: this is a readout and not a mark, and it must not change colour
-- because of what it happens to land over.
--
-- **A gesture is a press**, mostly. Game:updateDrawing already has the one
-- place a new press begins (`down and not self.wasDown`) and the one place it
-- ends (`elseif not down`), and every tool on the strip passes through both of
-- them whichever block it takes -- a brush, the compass's sweep, the
-- pushpin's drop, the ruler's snap, the scissors' cut. So that is what bounds
-- a gesture here too, rather than a second idea of one invented for this
-- file: Game calls `beginGesture` and `endGesture` at those two edges and
-- nothing else has to know a word can be said at all.
--
-- **Except that a press ending is not always a tool finishing.** A pushpin's
-- crater does not land the instant you tap -- it falls for a quarter of a
-- second first (`FALL`, src/pin.lua). A compass's ring does not cut on the
-- drag that set its width, it cuts while the arm spends real seconds coming
-- round after you have already let go (`Compass:swing`, src/compass.lua).
-- And the scissors' second tap only prints a dotted line -- the blades close
-- along it over the next several frames (`Scissors:strike`,
-- src/scissors.lua). All three finish well after the release edge above has
-- already run, so a straight press-to-release window would watch every pin,
-- every compass sweep and every cut in the game die silent. `hold` and
-- `release` are the fix: whatever spawns a kill that can only land after its
-- own press is over calls `hold` when it is spawned and `release` when it
-- finally resolves, and the window stays open -- independently of whether a
-- *new* press has started in the meantime -- until every hold still
-- outstanding has been matched.
--
-- One thing falls out of counting it that way and is worth being honest
-- about: a kill landed by an automatic weapon (a sword swinging on its own, a
-- sun long since risen) counts too, as long as it lands while some gesture or
-- some hold happens to be open. That is not a bug worth chasing down -- a run
-- holding the pointer through a crowd, or one whose pin has not landed yet, is
-- a run *doing something*, and crediting the windfall to it reads the way it
-- should. What it must never do is fire off a kill nobody's press is anywhere
-- near: a wall's ink coming off nine seconds after it was drawn (`pop`,
-- src/stroke.lua) lands with nothing open at all and is silently not
-- counted, which is correct.
--
-- The same word has one other use: a worksheet's verdict (`shout`), which is
-- the page saying how the sheet you stopped for went, in the voice it already
-- uses for "that worked". It has nothing to do with the window above.
