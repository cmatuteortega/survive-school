-- The library: everything the draft can ever hand you, written out.
--
-- Every other screen in this game asks you something. This one does not, and
-- that is the whole of what it is: the draft deals three cards out of a hundred
-- and ninety levels and never says what the other hundred and eighty-seven were, so
-- a run is played against a catalogue you can only learn by being dealt it. The
-- library is the back of the book you are allowed to read before the lesson
-- starts -- what tools exist, what fights for you, what a passive line becomes
-- four levels in -- and it costs the run nothing, because it is off the timetable
-- rather than on the way through it.
--
-- **Nothing here is answered, so nothing here is scribbled.** Every box in the
-- game (src/scribble.lua) is a thing you cannot take back, and there is nothing
-- on this page you could take back: you press a name to read it, you press an
-- arrow to turn to another section, and you press the corner to close it. That is
-- the same rule the timetable's tabs are drawn along -- choosing what to *look*
-- at is not a question -- applied to a screen where looking is all there is. Ink
-- that lands anywhere else is still just ink and still fades off the page, since
-- the page is a page.
--
-- Four things arrange it:
--
-- **The shelf** is every line of the section, an icon and a name apiece, laid out
-- in as many columns as the page will take -- bar the fusions, which are behind
-- the toggle below. It is the index: pressing one turns the page under it over to
-- that entry, and the picked name is the one in red.
--
-- It is written in the order the book gets them, not the order they were drawn:
-- the lines a fresh save already has first, then the rest in the order the ladder
-- opens them (see `shelfOrder`). So the top of every shelf is what a run can
-- actually be dealt today and the bottom is the queue, and the reading goes the
-- same way the collection does.
--
-- **The entry** is the picked line written out in full -- its name at twice the
-- size beside its icon, then one numbered row per level, in order, because a line
-- is *taken* in order and the fourth level of the pencil is only ever reached
-- through the first three. That is the fact the draft cannot tell you: a card
-- shows you the level you are being offered, and this shows you the line it is
-- part of.
--
-- **The shelf and the entry are the two pages of a spread** (src/spread.lua) --
-- the index on the verso and the line it opens on the recto, which is what a
-- reference book has always done with exactly this pair of things. Where there is
-- only one leaf to play with (a phone held upright) they stack, the shelf above
-- and the entry under it, which is where they both were before there was a fold
-- at all.
--
-- **The footer** is `<` the section `>`, at the foot of the page, the studio's
-- roster arrows doing the studio's job (src/studio.lua): two arrows either side
-- of the name of the thing they step. Tools, then what fights for you, then the
-- numbers about you -- which is the order the catalogue itself is written in and
-- the order a run reads them in. A section is a spread, so the arrows turn a
-- leaf, and so does a finger dragged across the page.
--
-- **The toggle** is the word EVOLUTIONS in the bottom left corner, and it is the
-- one thing on this page that changes what the page *is* rather than which part
-- of it you are reading.
--
-- Down -- which is how the screen opens -- the fusions (src/upgrades.lua) are not
-- on the tool shelf at all. That is worth the paragraph, because it is the one
-- thing this screen hides. A fusion is not a line you can be dealt: it is what
-- two finished lines turn into, so twenty-four of them sitting in the middle of the
-- ten tools is twenty-four names a run cannot ask for, listed exactly as flatly as
-- the ten it can -- and there are more fusions now than there are tools to make
-- them out of, so on the shelf they would be most of the page. The shelf is the
-- index of what the draft deals, and that is what it should read as.
--
-- Up, the shelf stops being an index and becomes a pair of picks: press two tools
-- and the block underneath is what those two make of each other, or a line saying
-- they make nothing. Which is the one question the rest of the book cannot answer,
-- because it is not a question about a line at all -- it is a question about two
-- of them, and there is nowhere on a page of single entries to ask it.
--
-- The picks are marked on the *icons*, in the blush a fused tool's own drawing
-- wears everywhere in the game (`Hud.drawIcon`), and not in the red the shelf
-- already spends on where you are reading. Two colours, one meaning each: red is
-- the name under your finger, blush is a tool going into a fusion -- which is
-- what blush already meant on the card that offers one.
--
-- It is lettering rather than a box, and it is pressed the way a name on the
-- shelf is, because that is what it is: the one vocabulary this screen has for a
-- thing you press is a word that goes red once it is the one you picked. And it
-- is only drawn on a shelf that has evolutions on it, since a word offering
-- nothing is worse than no word.
--
-- The page is read from the top down rather than centred, the shelf's columns are
-- cut to the widest name in the whole book and the shelf itself is given the room
-- the fullest shelf needs, so the heading, every name on the shelf and the top of
-- the entry under it are in the same place on all three sections. That is the timetable's
-- rule and it matters more here: this is a screen you read by pressing one name
-- after another, and a list that reflowed under your finger would be a list you had
-- to find your place in again every time.

-- Two thirds of the catalogue is not in the book on a fresh save

-- as the hole it is -- its icon as a silhouette, its name in graphite -- and where
-- its levels would have been read there is the one thing it asks for instead.
--
-- The name is deliberately *not* hidden. A shelf of question marks is a wall, and
-- what makes a hole worth filling is knowing the shape of it: the point of the

-- a lock takes away is the reading of what each level does.
--
-- And the count hangs in the top right, at 1:1, level with the corner button --
-- the canteen's purse readout in the canteen's corner, for the canteen's reason.
-- It is furniture rather than page: how much of the book there is is a fact about
-- the book, so it does not move when a shelf is stepped and it is measured off
-- four figures rather than off the two showing.
--
-- It counts **what the screen is showing**, which is the shelves down and the
-- fusions up. One figure that follows the toggle rather than one figure over
-- everything, because the two halves fill at completely different rates and at
-- completely different times: the thirty-six are opened one at a time by quests
-- and the forty-five come in a flood, nine at once, every time the tool shelf
-- grows. Added together they were one number that said nothing about either --

-- you have met at the end of a page and who you have put down. So it is read the
-- way the rest of this screen is -- a shelf of names on the verso, the one you
-- pressed written out on the recto -- and what is written out is the boss itself,
-- on a turntable (src/turntable.lua): the body the fight draws, turned round once
-- every few seconds so you can see the back of it.
--
-- **Three states, and the shelf and the entry say all three.**
--
-- - **Not met** -- no boss of that kind has walked onto a page of this book. Its
--   name is ??? and it is drawn as its silhouette: the shape of the hole, the
--   collection's own rule (a hole worth filling is one whose shape you know),
--   with the one thing a lock should take away -- who it is -- taken away.
-- - **Met** -- it has walked on, and whatever happened next, you know its name.
--   Still a silhouette, because seeing it properly is what beating it buys.
-- - **Beaten** -- the body in its own colours, turning, and how many times.
--
-- Read off src/tally.lua (`Tally.metOf`, `Tally.beatOf`), through `Dev.opened`
-- (`bossMet`, `bossBeaten`), and the tally is written the
-- moment a boss walks on and the moment one goes down for good.
--
-- **The shelf is a column of names with a pip each**, the homework's pip, filled
-- red once that boss is beaten, rather than the catalogue's grid of icons: there
-- is no icon for a boss, and fourteen names in a column are fourteen rows of
-- lettering where fourteen plates would be fourteen rows of icons. It is cut to
-- the widest boss name in the book, so the column does not move as a name stops
-- being ???, and laid out on its own grid rather than on the catalogue's -- the
-- names are longer than any line's, and the catalogue's columns are not to be

-- the program plays and nothing here reads a run at all, so there is nothing to
-- rebuild when the screen is opened again.
--
-- What *is* rebuilt every frame is which of them are in the book: that is a
-- question about the register (src/records.lua) and the register can change
-- between one opening of this screen and the next -- or, on a run that has just
-- ended, between two frames of it.
local shelves

-- And the lines no shelf carries: the fusions, read out under a pair of picks
-- instead of down a column (`Library:pairing`). One flat list rather than one per
-- section, since what is asked of it is always "do these two make anything" and
-- never "what is on this shelf".
local fusions

-- What order a shelf is written in: the lines in the book from the start, and then
-- the rest in the order the ladder opens them (`Collection.rank`, which is a line's
-- place in src/collection.lua's one list of gates). A free line has no rank at all,
-- which is what puts the whole free block on top -- the shelf is not sorted into
-- open and shut, it is sorted by *when*, and never having been shut is the earliest
-- when there is.
--
-- The catalogue's own order is the tiebreaker, and it has to be there: `table.sort`
-- in LuaJIT is not stable, so two lines that are both free would otherwise swap
-- places between one build and the next for no reason anybody could see.
--
-- **It is sorted once, and it does not resort as the book fills.** Both keys are
-- facts about the catalogue rather than about the register: whether a line has a
-- gate and where that gate sits are the same on run one and run four hundred, so
-- the shelf a player learns the shape of is the shelf they keep. A list ordered by
-- what is *currently* open would be a list that rearranged itself under the finger
-- of the person who just filled a hole in it, which is exactly the thing the
-- top-down layout above is at pains not to do -- and it would do it at the one
-- moment the player has most reason to be looking.
--
-- What it buys is that a shelf answers two questions in the reading order you ask
-- them in. What can I be dealt right now is the block at the top; what is coming
-- and in what order is the block under it, top to bottom. Before this the two were
-- interleaved by catalogue order, which is the order the lines were *written* --
-- so a fresh book's weapons shelf had its four playable lines sitting second,
-- fourth, sixth and eighth in a column of graphite.
--
-- It also groups the derived gates without being told to, since they are appended
-- to the ladder in blocks: the tools shelf comes out as the two the quests hand
-- over, then the scissors, then the seven the timetable does, and the weapons shelf
-- ends on the three that belong to heroes you have not bought. That is a shelf
-- sorted by who is holding it back, one step below being sorted by when.
