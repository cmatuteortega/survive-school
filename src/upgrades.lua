-- What levelling up offers you.
--
-- Every upgrade is a *line*: a row here with a list of levels, taken one at a
-- time and always in order. Nothing outside this file knows what any of them
-- do. The draft (src/levelup.lua) offers whichever lines still have a level
-- left in them, and the run's loadout (src/loadout.lua) replays every level it
-- has ever taken, from scratch, whenever anything changes.
--
-- That replay is why a level is written as a function of the thing it changes
-- rather than a patch applied once and forgotten. Taking the fifth level of the
-- ruler re-runs levels one to five over a *fresh copy* of the tool, so no level
-- has to know what the ones before it did, nothing can drift after a few
-- hundred applications of a multiplier, and a number that depends on something
-- outside the run -- the one ruler upgrade measured off the page you can see --
-- is simply recomputed when that changes.
--
--   id       what the loadout files the line under
--   name     what the card says, in a 3x5 font: keep it short
--   icon     a sprite from Sprites.icons
--   kind     "weapon" (something that fights for you), "tool" (something you
--            draw with) or "passive" (a number about you)
--   tool     for kind == "tool": the name of the row in Tools.list it upgrades.
--            A line whose tool has been shelved is never offered.
--   design   for a thing you draw rather than one you are handed: the name of a
--            design in src/design.lua. Taking the first level of the line puts
--            you on the board to draw it, the way the hero is drawn.
--   weight   how often it comes up against the other lines (default 1)
--   levels   in order. Each is { text, apply }:
--              text    what the card says this level does
--              apply(target, screen)  `target` is the run's stat block, or --
--                      for a tool line -- the run's copy of that tool. `screen`
--                      is { w, h } of the canvas, for the one upgrade that is
--                      measured off the page rather than written down here.
--
-- Adding a line is a row here plus an icon in src/sprites.lua. Adding a passive
-- weapon is a row here whose first level puts a block on the stats, a module
-- that flies it, and a row in src/loadout.lua's WEAPONS pairing the two -- plus,
-- if it is something the player should draw, a design in src/design.lua and the

-- there is nothing to apply because the tool turning up is the whole of the
-- upgrade. Which is why the loadout can read "is this tool equipped" straight
-- off `levelOf(line) > 0` and no tool needs a flag of its own saying so.
--
-- Everything after the unlock is that tool getting better, and is handed the
-- run's copy of it exactly as before. The intended shape is five -- the unlock
-- and four upgrades -- and all ten tool lines have their four written now. They
-- were not always: the pen, the stapler and the scissors were unlock-only for a
-- long time, and the draft handled that on its own by never offering a line with
-- no level left in it. What finishing a line is *for* has since become a second
-- thing as well, since a fusion may only be made of lines a run can finish
-- (`needs` in `fusionLine` below) -- the pen's four are why the CORRAL exists.
--
-- Four rather than six since the trim, and two rules picked which two went from
-- each line. The first was the flat ink discount, which every one of the seven
-- had a copy of and the blotter sells to all of them at once. The second was
-- whatever a passive already sold or a later level already overwrote -- the
-- compass's lap and a half against its two, the ruler's 135 against a length
-- the finale measures off the screen. Nothing that a finale stands on went:
-- the rubber keeps the 240 its ram is timed against.
--
-- `opts.levels` is everything after the unlock.
--
-- Nothing here says which tool a run begins holding: that is the lesson's to say
-- (`tool` in src/subjects.lua) and `Loadout.new` takes the named line to level
-- one before the run is built. A line does not need to know whether it was

-- A *fusion*: a tool line the draft will not deal until every line it is made of
-- has been taken to its last level, and which takes some of those lines off the
-- run as it lands.
--
-- It is a tool line and nothing more exotic than one. Its first level unlocks a
-- tool, its levels are replayed on that tool's copy, it counts against the four
-- places on the strip, the library lists it on the tool shelf and the selector
-- column draws it -- none of which had to be told fusions exist. Two fields are
-- the whole of it:
--
--   needs   line ids that must all be *finished* before this is ever offered.
--           A condition and only a condition -- nothing is taken from a line
--           for being named here.
--   fuses   which of those the run actually spends: their tools come off the
--           strip and their slots come back. Always a subset of `needs`, and
--           always at least one line of this line's own kind, which is what
--           makes a fusion cost the strip *less* than it gives back -- two
--           tools in, one out, one place free. The levels themselves are not
--           refunded and never could be: they are what was fused.
--
-- The split between the two is the interesting half. A fusion may ask for
-- something it does not consume -- the HALO wants a finished FIXATIVE and gives
-- it back untouched -- and that is how a fusion is aimed at a *build* rather than
-- at a pair of tools. What the run had to have been doing to get here is a
-- condition; what the run hands over is a cost; a catalyst is the first without
-- the second.
--
-- Nothing else in the game changes. `Loadout:candidates` is where `needs` is
-- asked and `Loadout:rebuild` is where `fuses` is spent, and both are one clause.

-- copies for `rulesThePage`'s reason -- every number in it is a parent's finished
-- one, and a fusion whose parent moved a number would want it moved in all three.

-- not in `Tools.BLOCKS`, so `Tools.copy` does not lift it onto the run's own copy;
-- a table written on the shared row that `scaleDamage` then writes into would
-- compound its multiplier on every rebuild for the rest of the program's life. It
-- is the STITCH's and the SNAG's `fasten`, one shape over.
--
-- The scissors' line, level by level, is all of it: the cap off (`reach`), the deep
-- stretch between the two ends (`blades`), the run-on to both edges (`through`) and
-- the half you are not standing on coming away (`sever`). A fusion is only dealt
-- once both its lines are finished, so a finished pair of scissors is what a fused
-- row inherits.
--
-- `ink` is the parent's own flat 0.3 -- what a cut has always cost -- charged at the
-- release and refused rather than clamped. The row's own `ink` is a price per pixel
-- and stays that, so a run is paying for the line it drew and then for the cut, one
-- each, which is the two halves of the gesture priced as the two things they are.
--
-- `opts` is what one row adds and the others do not: `tapped` for a mark with no two
-- ends worth cutting between (the SHEAR), `ignite` for blades that leave what they
-- cut burning (the SCORCH), `paste` for a crowd that arrives in the corner stuck (the
-- COLLAGE). Every one of them is a field `src/scissors.lua` already reads.
--
-- `paste` rather than a second `hold`: the chord already carries one and it is the

    -- MARKER and COMPASS are the pair, and they are the pair because they are
    -- the two lines that end up wanting the same thing and cannot both have it.
    -- The marker's band is the best ground in the game and the worst to place --
    -- it goes where your hand goes, which is to say where *you* are, and the
    -- crowd it is for is the crowd you are trying not to be standing in. The
    -- compass is the one tool that reaches away from you and the one that leaves
    -- nothing behind: a circle drawn round a horde you are nowhere near, that
    -- cuts once and is gone. Each is exactly what the other is missing, and a run
    -- that finished both spent eight of its levels learning that the hard way.
    -- What it gets for them is the band drawn where the circle went.
    --
    -- The catalyst is a passive on purpose, and this is where that rule is set
    -- down once for all forty-five. A fusion asking only for the two tools it
    -- eats would be a thing a run walks into by drafting greedily; asking for a
    -- third line the run cannot spend on either tool is what makes it a build
    -- rather than a coincidence. It is never consumed: whatever the third line
    -- was doing for the run goes on doing it afterwards, because the run earned
    -- it and the fusion did not eat it.
    --
    -- **FIXATIVE is the line, and what picks it is that this row's worth is a
    -- clock.** What the arm leaves behind is a band of fire that ticks for 3.6
    -- seconds (`life`), and `scalePersistence` reaches that number -- so a
    -- finished fixative is the difference between a ring you drew round a horde
    -- and a ring the horde is still standing in. A choice and not a tax: the band
    -- ticks its 5 either way, and 3.6 seconds is already a real ring. The fire
    -- itself does not move -- `ignite` is neither `life` nor `freeze`, so nothing
    -- here stretches the 2 seconds of burn, only the paper it is burning on.
    --
    -- What the tool is is entirely in src/tools.lua, and what it costs the strip
    -- is entirely in `fuses`: the marker and the compass come off, the halo goes
    -- on, and one of the four places is free again.

        -- something it has no way left to choose against.
    }),

    -- The second fusion, and it is the first one's argument told from the other
    -- side of the compass.
    --
    -- PENCIL and COMPASS are the pair, and what makes them a pair is a hole in
    -- the compass that the pencil is the only line in the game shaped to fill.
    -- A compass cuts the circle it draws and never the middle of it -- the inside
    -- of one is the safest place on the page, and that is the tool rather than a
    -- flaw in it. The pencil's own finale is the same idea drawn by hand and from
    -- the other end: close a line on itself and everything the ring holds is cut.
    -- It is cheap because the ring is yours to draw, badly, around a crowd that is
    -- walking away from you. Fuse them and the ring is drawn *for* you -- perfect,
    -- at whatever width you dragged, around a crowd you are nowhere near -- and
    -- the safest place on the page stops being anywhere.
    --
    -- So the two fusions off the compass are two answers to the same question and
    -- a run may only ever have one of them: the halo makes the *rim* worth
    -- standing on, and this makes the middle worth surrounding. The pencil is the
    -- more painful half to hand over of the two -- it is the tool every run opens
    -- holding, so this is the one card in the draft that can leave you without
    -- one -- and that is the price of the only tool that claims an area at reach.
    --
    -- SELLOTAPE is the catalyst, and it is the first of the ten rows that ask
    -- for it. What the tape pays a run for is *time*, the currency a run that
    -- committed ten levels to two tools has already been spending -- and it says
    -- nothing at all about a line, which is exactly the qualification here.
    -- Every economy line the strip sells would be a lie or a tax on this row:
    -- the price is flat (0.45 a press), so the blotter cannot reach it; the ring
    -- is drawn for you in one gesture, so there is no chain to fit inside a well
    -- and no next one to get to sooner; and the ring closes and is gone, so there
    -- is no clock to stretch.
    --
    -- **That is the tape's job in this catalogue.** It is the catalyst for the
    -- rows no economy line can speak to without becoming the row's own
    -- prerequisite, and there are ten of them. It was once the third line of all
    -- twenty-four fusions off the compass, the pushpin and the ruler, which made
    -- it a toll rather than a sentence -- a run that finished it opened half the
    -- book at once. Ten is what is left when every row that had a better ask got
    -- one.

    -- The third fusion, and the one that says what the pattern is.
    --
    -- GLUESTICK and COMPASS are a pair for the plainest reason of the three. The
    -- smear is the strongest thing a run can put on the page and the hardest to
    -- put anywhere useful: what it does is stop everything standing on it, so
    -- where it wants to be is under the crowd -- and getting it there means
    -- dragging your own hand through the crowd, which is the one place a run
    -- spends its whole time trying not to be. Every level of the line makes that
    -- worse rather than better: a wider head, deeper cuts on what it holds, a
    -- tear on the way loose and a field that pulls the crowd in are all reasons
    -- to want the paste further from you than your arm reaches. The compass is
    -- the only tool in the game that reaches away from you at all.
    --
    -- So this is the fusion with the least invention in it and the most
    -- consequence: nothing about the glue changes, and it is simply laid where it
    -- was always meant to go. See the MOAT row in src/tools.lua for the one
    -- decision that falls out of copied numbers -- a head 20 wide against a
    -- smallest circle of 16, so the drag now chooses between a plug of paste and
    -- a wall of it.
    --
    -- SELLOTAPE a second time, and here it is the *tax rule* doing the choosing
    -- rather than an absence. This row's whole worth is per second it is on the
    -- page -- six seconds of paste that softens, tears and pulls -- so the
    -- FIXATIVE is the line it wants most of anything on the strip, and that is
    -- precisely why it may not be the ask. A catalyst that is the line a row
    -- cannot play without is a tax and not a choice (the CLINCH's rule, argued at
    -- the foot of this file). The tape is what is left when the one line with
    -- something to say about the row would also be the row's prerequisite.

    -- The fourth fusion, and the only one that does no damage of any kind.
    --
    -- SCISSORS and COMPASS are the pair, and the argument is a shape rather than
    -- a number. The scissors reach anywhere and their last level writes into the
    -- page itself -- the half you are not standing on lifts off it, and every
    -- body standing on it lifts off with it -- and what they cannot do is choose
    -- which half. A cut is a straight line, so the only region a pair of scissors
    -- can take is half a page, which is an enormous amount of page to be deciding
    -- about with two taps, and the choice is really between two bad ones. The
    -- compass is the only tool that draws a *closed* line. Fuse them and the
    -- offcut is a disc you sized with the drag: the same finale, aimed.
    --
    -- **What the ring does is clear its own middle, and clear is the exact word --
    -- it does not empty it.** Everything inside is taken off the page and put down
    -- again in the corner of it furthest from you, not killed: no gem, no xp, no
    -- kill on the tally, nothing split and nothing burst, because nothing was
    -- hurt. See Game:liftEnemyTo for the contract and Compass:lift for the sweep.
    --
    -- It is the one tool in the game that buys nothing but room, and that is what
    -- separates it from the lasso rather than a number. Both are a ring that does
    -- something to the middle of itself, which is the one thing a compass has
    -- never done -- but the lasso's middle is a *hit*, 4 damage the instant the
    -- line closes, and this one's is a *place the horde is not*. Two cards
    -- arguing about how hard would have been the same card twice; two cards
    -- arguing about the verb are two builds. For a long while this one was a
    -- point every half second on ground that was visibly gone, and the honest
    -- reading of that is that it was a slow, worse lasso wearing the scissors'
    -- clothes.
    --
    -- And what it costs is the shape of the arrival rather than the run's xp. The
    -- disc does not spend the crowd it holds -- it stacks it in one corner, at the
    -- health it had, walking back -- so a punch is a fight postponed and gathered
    -- rather than a fight cancelled, which is the only way a card that clears a
    -- 66-pixel disc with one press can be allowed to exist.
    --
    -- **The price is the xp, and the price is why it can be absolute.** A disc
    -- opened on a crowd is every gem in that crowd not dropping, so the tool
    -- takes the run's own levelling to pay for the room -- and a build that
    -- reaches for it whenever the meter fills gets to the boss a level or two
    -- behind a build that fought for the same ground. Nothing has to be tuned to
    -- make that true; it falls out of not crediting the kill, which is the whole
    -- of the mechanism. It is also the reason this is a *panic* button rather
    -- than a rotation: the correct time to spend a level of your own is when the
    -- alternative is spending the run.
    --
    -- And the disc stays open, so the hole goes on being a hole for whatever
    -- walks into it while the rim is on the paper. That is the compass's own
    -- third-level distinction -- a hit against a place -- landing on the one
    -- fusion that took it literally.
    --
    -- One thing falls out of the split that nobody designed and that is worth
    -- keeping: **the rim still pays and the middle never does.** The ring cuts 12
    -- to whatever is standing on the line it draws, gems and all, and clears
    -- everything inside it for nothing -- so the same gesture is a kill at its edge
    -- and a shove to the far corner at its centre, and how wide you open it is a
    -- question about which of the two you came for. A small circle on a tight knot
    -- is a weapon; a wide one round a room is a broom, and a broom sweeps rather
    -- than burns. See the PUNCH row in src/tools.lua.
    -- TOP MARKS is the catalyst, and it is the first of three rows to ask for
    -- it. The paragraph above is the argument already: what a severed region
    -- holds is carried off and set down, not hurt, and `Game:liftEnemyTo` credits
    -- no gem, no xp and no kill on the tally -- so the middle of this ring is the
    -- run's own levelling, spent to buy room. A catalyst that says *you may have
    -- the tool that stops earning once you have fixed earning* is the one sentence
    -- this row was always making and nobody was charging for. Not a tax: the rim
    -- still cuts 12 to whatever is standing on the line it draws, gems and all.

    -- paper -- and all three of those happen at once, so the tool reads as a
    -- single event. A compass is the opposite: the slowest thing in the game to
    -- bring to bear and the only one whose hit you can watch travel, most of a
    -- second of promise.
    --
    -- Fuse them and the pushpin's two halves come apart in time. The crater is
    -- dragged round the rim, punching the chaff out the whole way; the survivor is
    -- picked up on the point and carried, in front of you, for a whole turn; and
    -- the pin goes through it into the page wherever the arm happens to stop. It
    -- is the pushpin's own design with the compass's clock inside it, and it needed
    -- both parents finished to be worth writing: a crater that killed everything
    -- would have nothing to carry, and an arm that arrived instantly would have
    -- nowhere to carry it.

    -- you are not, and it has no ends at all.
    --
    -- So this is the fusion that changes the shape of the fight rather than the
    -- numbers in it, and it is the only one of the six that does. The other five
    -- are things that happen to the crowd -- a ring that burns, closes, holds,
    -- lifts out, drags and pins -- and every one of them is over in a second or
    -- two. This one leaves a place. A closed pen ring is somewhere the crowd is,
    -- inside or outside, and with the pen's finale on it the ring has no clock: it
    -- stays until you swing the next one. What it costs is what the pen always
    -- charged for a wall -- the crowd is *held* rather than hurt, 2 a second to
    -- whatever leans on the ink and nothing at all to whatever does not, so a run
    -- that fenced the horde off has bought itself time and not a single kill.
    --
    -- It is also the one card in the draft that can leave a run boxed in on
    -- purpose, and that is worth saying out loud rather than patching: the player
    -- crosses their own ink freely, so a ring drawn round yourself is a fortress
    -- for as long as you stand still in it -- and standing still is the one thing
    -- a run cannot afford, because the gems are on the floor outside it, the eyes
    -- shoot over ink (Game:updateBullets) and the boss has to be killed rather
    -- than waited out. The pen's own last level was written with that same

    -- STAPLER and COMPASS are the pair, and what makes them one is that the
    -- stapler is the most *repetitive* tool on the strip and the compass is the
    -- only one that does anything at reach. Ten staples a meter, one press each,
    -- every one of them a 15px circle you have to land on something that is
    -- walking -- and all four of its levels are about making that press worth
    -- more (deeper, one in five straight through, torn back out two seconds later
    -- for a second bite) until the last one, which sells the ten presses back as a
    -- single drag. That drag is still yours to walk, though, in a straightish line,
    -- through the crowd you wanted the seam in front of. Give the stapler to the
    -- arm and the seam is raked round a circle you are nowhere near, evenly, and
    -- it closes -- a seam that meets itself is a hem.
    --
    -- **The one thing it invents is a price that the drag decides**, and it is the
    -- first in the game. Every other sweep costs one number at the needle and
    -- opens as wide as you like for nothing; a wider hem is more staples, and the
    -- stapler's whole line is written on the price of a staple never changing (see
    -- its finale: the level buys presses, not page). So the row carries a second
    -- price per staple and the drag is capped by the meter -- open it until the leg
    -- stops opening, which is the tool telling you how much wire is left in it. It
    -- is the one place in the game where a tool's reach is a thing you can run out
    -- of mid-gesture, and it reads as exactly what it is.
    --
    -- What it does *not* invent is anything a staple does. Landing, biting,
    -- critting, holding for two seconds, and either staying in the paper for the
    -- rest of the run or tearing back out of it are all Staple's, unchanged and

    -- ring on the same frame, so thirty-four come out on the same frame too. The

    -- on the page is a ring of staples, and a staple is two numbers a clock owns
    -- -- `life` 2 and `freeze` 2, both inside the `drop` that `scalePersistence`
    -- walks -- so a finished fixative is a ring still holding when the next rank

    -- The eighth fusion, and the only one aimed at where you are standing.
    --
    -- RUBBER and COMPASS are the pair, and the argument is the plainest in the
    -- book: the rubber is the tool that moves the crowd and it can only move the
    -- crowd that is already on top of you. What a rub does is shove -- 240 is a
    -- 27px throw, and the finale makes whatever it throws a weapon until it slows
    -- -- and every pixel of that has to be delivered by dragging your own hand
    -- through the thing you are trying to get away from. The compass is the only
    -- tool that reaches away from you. But this is the one fusion that does not
    -- want the reach: it wants the compass's *shape*, and the shape is a closed
    -- ring you can stand in the middle of.
    --
    -- So the leg sweeps the disc and everything inside goes straight out of it.
    -- Plant it on your own feet and the rank that had reached you leaves; plant it
    -- round a crowd and the crowd is scattered outwards instead of stirred round
    -- the rim, which is what the compass's own knock has always done. The middle
    -- of a compass was the safest place on the page -- three of its four levels are
    -- written on that -- and this is the one card that makes the middle the *only*
    -- thing it touches.
    --
    -- **Nothing dies**, and that is what pays for touching everything at once. 2 a
    -- body, 4 where the leg bites, which is what a rubber has always dealt and the
    -- one number its own line never moved. What the tool buys is a second and a
    -- half of empty page around you, and the only thing on it that can actually
    -- kill is the crowd hitting the crowd (`ram`, the rubber's finale, at 5 a
    -- collision).
    --
    -- **And it leaves nothing at all.** Every other fusion puts something on the
    -- paper -- a band, a graphite ring, a smear, a hole, a pin, a fence, a row of
    -- staples -- and a rubber's mark is over the moment you let go (`life = 0`,
    -- copied straight across). So the circle is drawn in graphite as the arm
    -- follows it and gone with the arm, which makes this the cleanest thing in the
    -- game to look at afterwards and the only sweep that leaves the page exactly as
    -- it found it.
    --
    -- Two of the rubber's four levels have nothing to land in, which is more than
    -- any other fusion drops and worth being straight about: `lean` is a tip that
    -- keeps hitting while it rests and an arm never rests, `scrub` is half price
    -- over ground already covered and there is no per-pixel price here at all. Both
    -- are about the wrist and the meter, and a sweep has neither. See the CLEARING
    -- row in src/tools.lua.
    --
    -- MAGNET, and it is the first of three rows to ask for it. The only damage
    -- this tool does that can kill anything is dealt by the crowd to itself, out
    -- past where you were standing when you opened the disc (`ram`, and the
    -- CLEARING row in src/tools.lua) -- so every gem this row earns drops at the
    -- far edge of a circle you are in the middle of, and the pickup radius is the
    -- one number that decides whether the run is paid for the rub at all. A

    -- has ever held them already knows. Two arcs from two centres cross at two
    -- points; lay the straight edge through those two points. It is the first
    -- construction anybody is taught, and it is the only fusion in the game whose
    -- two halves were designed to be used together by somebody other than us.
    --
    -- What each half brings is the other's missing piece, and it is not reach --
    -- both of these already reach. **A ruler's line goes through you.** That is its
    -- one real limitation and no level of it moves: it is 200px long and it can be
    -- 400, and every pixel of that is on a line through your own feet, so what you
    -- get to choose is which way the page is swept and never *where*. The compass
    -- is the only tool that goes somewhere you are not -- but it can only ever draw
    -- a closed ring. Put the two together and the ruler's line is a **chord**: it
    -- sits square to the line joining the two needles, half way along, as long as
    -- the overlap is deep, and nowhere near you. Both ends were placed by placing
    -- two needles, which makes this the one thing on the strip you aim by drawing
    -- something else twice.
    --
    -- **It is the first tool whose second half is a relationship between two
    -- marks**, and that is the interesting half of the card. Everything else on the
    -- strip is a gesture landing. This one needs two swings, close enough together
    -- that the first ring has not faded (2.2s past the arm stopping), and neither
    -- swing is worth anything alone -- one circle rules nothing at all. So the
    -- price is paid in *gestures*: 0.4 twice, most of a full meter, before a single
    -- line comes down. Nothing else here charges like that, and nothing else here
    -- has a window you read off the paper rather than off a number -- the fading
    -- ring is the timer.
    --
    -- One parent level has nothing to land in, and it is the ruler's finale. How
    -- far this ruler reaches is not the tool's to decide any more -- the two
    -- circles are 66 at the widest, so the chord can never pass 132 against the
    -- 400 the last level buys. The reach is what was sold and the position is what
    -- was bought, which is the trade written out. See the FOLD row in
    -- src/tools.lua.
    --
    -- CARTRIDGE, and it is the price that picks it. A fold is *two* presses --
    -- two arcs from two centres, and the ruler falls where they cross -- so 0.4 a
    -- press is 0.8 a fold and a base meter holds exactly one. Nothing about this
    -- row is short of room; what it is short of is the next fold, and the
    -- cartridge is the only line on the strip that sells one.

    -- The tenth fusion, and the first one that is not the compass.
    --
    -- Nine of them are one instrument wearing another, and the reason given every
    -- time was that the compass is the only tool that reaches away from you. That
    -- was half of the truth. **A pushpin also lands wherever you tapped and never
    -- where your hand is** -- what a pin has never had is a *line*. It is a point,
    -- and a point cannot be a shape, a fence or a band however far off you put it.
    --
    -- PENCIL and PUSHPIN are the pair, then, and they are a pair for the LASSO's
    -- reason read from the other end. The pencil's finale is the only level in the
    -- game that claims an *area*, and it claims it by asking you to draw the border
    -- yourself -- badly, one-handed, around a crowd that is walking away from you
    -- while you draw it. The LASSO answers that by having the border drawn for you,
    -- perfectly, at whatever width you dragged. This answers it by letting you
    -- **build** the border: drop pins and the pencil joins up the ones that are
    -- close, and a circuit of them cuts everything it holds. The corners are
    -- exactly where you tapped, and every corner punched a 51px crater and pinned
    -- whatever survived it on the way in.
    --
    -- So the two halves genuinely need each other, which is the test a fusion has
    -- to pass. The pin gets the thing it never had -- a line, and therefore a shape
    -- -- and the pencil gets the thing it never had, which is a border it does not
    -- have to be standing next to. And a run may only hold one of the pencil's two
    -- answers, since both lines eat it (`fuses`): the LASSO is a ring the tool
    -- draws and you place, this is a ring you place a corner at a time.
    --
    -- It is the dearest way to close a ring in the game and the slowest: three taps
    -- and a meter and a half against the LASSO's one press. What it buys for that
    -- is a shape of any number of sides, in any shape at all, made out of three
    -- hits that were worth taking on their own.
    --
    -- CARTRIDGE, and this is where the threading family's ask is argued for all
    -- five of them.

    -- Half a meter is two taps and therefore exactly one thread (see the row in
    -- src/tools.lua), so the obvious read is that the INKWELL is the line -- and
    -- the numbers say otherwise. A 0.5 press comes back in 0.5 / `Tools.REGEN`
    -- plus `Tools.DELAY`, which is about 1.9 seconds, and a pin stands in the
    -- paper for 4 (`PIN.life`). The third post arrives with the first two still
    -- there: **the chain already crosses wells at base**, so what gates the shape
    -- is the trickle and not the room.
    --
    -- Which is the SNAG's own test run the other way round. That row asks for the
    -- well because its hold is two seconds and the meter does not come back
    -- inside two; these five ask for the trickle because their window is twice
    -- their refill. One rule, two answers, and the number that separates them is

    -- The eleventh, and the second answer the pen has been given to the same
    -- question.
    --
    -- PEN and PUSHPIN, and what makes them a pair is the CORRAL's argument with a
    -- different answer at the end of it. A pen is terrain, terrain is only worth
    -- anything where the fight is, and drawing a fence means walking the length of
    -- the wall you wanted through the crowd you wanted it against. Worse, the line
    -- is *open*, and a fence with two ends is a fence the crowd walks round.
    --
    -- The CORRAL fixes both by putting the nib on an arm that draws a closed circle
    -- at reach. This fixes both by driving posts: tap and a pin lands where you
    -- tapped, tap again nearby and a rail is strung between the two, and what you
    -- get is a fence in whatever shape you tapped it -- a line across a corridor, a
    -- spur off the one you laid ten seconds ago, a triangle round a spawn. Closed
    -- if you close it, and closed is your decision rather than the tool's.
    --
    -- **And every post is worth driving on its own**, which is the half the corral
    -- cannot match. A compass leg laying a fence is a compass leg laying a fence;
    -- each pin here is the biggest single hit in the game -- a 51px crater and a
    -- pinned tank -- and the wall is what you get for having placed two of them
    -- near each other. A tool whose entire cost was going to where the wall had to
    -- be now pays you for standing each end of it up.
    --
    -- One parent level has nothing to land in, and it is the pen's finale. "THE
    -- LAST LINE STAYS UNTIL YOU DRAW ANOTHER" is a rule about one gesture's worth
    -- of wall, and a fence built pin by pin is not one gesture -- it would let go
    -- of every rail but the newest as you built the thing. What it bought is bought
    -- instead by the posts: a thread is on the page for as long as both its pins
    -- are, on all three of these rows, whether the parent paid for it or not. Which
    -- is bounded better than `keep` was, and by something you can see rather than by
    -- a rule -- a pin holds for four seconds, so a player who keeps tapping still
    -- cannot lattice the page shut. See the STOCKADE row in src/tools.lua.

    -- the crowd you are trying not to be standing in. Both fusions off the marker
    -- answer that with reach; what they differ in is the shape the reach arrives
    -- in, and a run may only have one of them.
    --
    -- A halo is a ring: you open it out to the width you want and swing it once,
    -- and the tool decides everything about the shape but its size. A cordon is a
    -- strip between two points you chose -- across a doorway, or a Y, or a triangle
    -- with a burning edge -- and a crater at every corner of it, because every
    -- corner was a pin. Which is the trade the whole pushpin family makes: the
    -- compass hands you a perfect shape you cannot choose, and pins hand you any
    -- shape at all, one expensive tap at a time.

    -- pool -- and a pin has never had one. The stapler has no nib either. It is a

    -- path; the two tools have differed in nothing but the numbers inside one block
    -- since the day they were written. So this row is not two shapes on a page, it
    -- is one block laid over another -- and they are opposites field for field,
    -- which is what makes the overlay worth doing. One big telegraphed decision
    -- against a hundred small ones. Take the pin's numbers and the staple's
    -- gesture and you have a tool; take them the other way round and you have a
    -- staple that makes you wait a quarter of a second for it, which is nothing at
    -- all. There is exactly one interesting way to read the pair.
    --
    -- Three fields come across and each of them *retires* a pushpin level rather
    -- than sitting beside it. `instant` takes off the fall the pin's own file argues
    -- so carefully for -- the promise that a report is coming, eleven pixels of bat,
    -- the reason a tap on a moving target is not a certainty -- because a stapler
    -- has never had one. `rake` is the stapler's own finale, unchanged and running
    -- through the same `Game:rakeDrops`: a tap is still one pin, and holding the
    -- pointer down rakes a seam of craters 48 apart, which is the parent's written
    -- rule ("so the circles just overlap") read at a 25px bite instead of a 7px
    -- one. And `crit` replaces `point`: both are a multiplier on one hit and they
    -- differ only in what decides it, and *aim* cannot decide it on a tool whose
    -- gesture is a drag -- what you choose in a seam is a line, and which body each
    -- step lands its point on is luck.
    --
    -- **Which is where the two upgrade lines above turn out to have been arguing
    -- with each other.** The stapler's crit level is written on the claim that a
    -- one-in-five is a *rate* only when the sample is large, "where the same roll on
    -- a pin you get two of from a full meter would only ever be a story about one
    -- pin". Four a meter, raked, is the sample that makes it a rate. The drag is
    -- what legitimises the crit, and the crit is what pays for the aim the drag gave
    -- up.
    --
    -- What survives from the pin is the crater, the hold and `drive`, and `drive` is
    -- where a seam pays off in a way a tap never could. Its own row is careful that
    -- "a pin dropped on a *lone* skull changes nothing at all" -- the exception to
    -- "the tank walks out of the crater" has to be earned through the crowd standing
    -- round it -- and a rake is how a crowd gets under a circle on purpose. The
    -- craters do not overlap, so nothing here doubles up: what a seam does to a grin
    -- is hit it as it goes past and again on the next step. The tank dies to being
    -- *raked across*.
    --
    -- One of the stapler's four levels has nothing to land in, on the CLEARING's
    -- terms: `prise` is wire pulled back out of the paper for a second bite, and
    -- what this row drives in is a pin -- a hole, with nothing to pull. A crater
    -- does not come out again, and the pin's own file is the argument for why not.
    --
    -- FIXATIVE, the HEM's argument at the pushpin's numbers: the pin this row
    -- rakes into the page carries `freeze` 4 and `life` 4 inside its `drop`, and
    -- both are numbers `scalePersistence` walks. A seam of pins that holds a

    -- price is the *gap* between their two taps -- the horde keeps walking through
    -- it, so the row of blobs the first tap lined up is not the row the second one
    -- cuts, and a cut has to be led rather than aimed. A ruler has no gap: held,
    -- turned, released, and the page opens along the line in the frame it landed. So
    -- what this buys is a cut that can be *aimed*, and what it pays with is the one
    -- thing a ruler cannot give -- a line that goes anywhere but through your own
    -- feet.
    --
    -- 12 from the band and 20 from the blades is 32, the deepest single hit in the
    -- game, and the grin has 34. The tank goes on walking out of everything, which
    -- is its job.
    --
    -- **And the scissors' finale is the level this row is really about.** `sever`
    -- lifts "the half you are not standing on" off the page with everything on it,
    -- and a ruler's line goes *through* you -- so at the moment this lands there is
    -- no such half. Every other cut in the game freezes the answer off the tap that
    -- placed it; freezing one here would pick a half off a floating-point sign,
    -- which is a page-wide finale decided by nothing.
    --
    -- So this one keeps asking. It re-reads your feet every frame (`follows` on the
    -- sever, `Scissors:takeSides`): straddle the slit and neither half goes, step
    -- off it and the half you left goes with everything on it, cross back and it is
    -- the other half instead. The ruler's one central fact stops being what breaks
    -- the level and becomes what aims it -- the pivot is your feet, so the offcut is
    -- wherever your feet are not, and choosing it is *walking* rather than tapping.
    --
    -- It is the same move the TEAR LINE made on the same level from the other side:
    -- there three pins are three cuts each picking their own half and what is left
    -- is a page in ribbons. Both generalise the parent's sentence rather than break
    -- it, and neither costs the parent anything -- an ordinary cut still freezes its
    -- half, because a cut you placed with two taps has a side you chose.
    --
    -- The FOLD is still the row to read beside this one: it gave up the ruler's own
    -- finale for the mirror image of the same fact. Between them they say the thing
    -- worth knowing about fusing anything into a ruler -- **the pivot is your own
    -- feet, and every parent level that assumed otherwise has to be looked at.**
    --
    -- A run may hold only one of the scissors' three answers, and all three now end
    -- in the same level read three different ways: the PUNCH takes a disc out of the
    -- page and lifts what is standing in it, the TEAR LINE cuts the page to ribbons

    -- half of the page you step off carries the run's own levelling away with it
    -- while the difficulty clock goes on climbing. This is the one line on the
    -- strip that answers that, and it is a condition and not a tax -- the `snap`
    -- half still cuts 12 to whatever is standing on the line, so the row earns
    -- something either way.

    -- nothing at all about a line. Twenty-four rows asking for it made it a toll
    -- rather than a sentence. The INKWELL says something.
    --
    -- Which is the rule the rest of the catalogue was eventually held to, and the
    -- twenty-four came apart under it: six of them ask the fixative for a clock
    -- they leave running, six the cartridge for the next press, three the magnet
    -- for xp thrown out of reach and three top marks for xp never credited at
    -- all. Ten still ask the tape, and the LASSO says what they have in common --
    -- it is the catalyst for a row no economy line can speak to without becoming
    -- that row's prerequisite. This family is where the argument starts. All five of these are priced by the pixel,
    -- three of them want one long unbroken gesture to work at all, and the meter
    -- is the only thing standing between a pencil and the whole page -- so a run
    -- that finished the well is a run that has been *drawing*, which is the
    -- condition this family is actually aimed at. It is given back untouched
    -- exactly as the tape is, on the same terms: a fusion may ask for something it
    -- does not consume, and that is how it is aimed at a build rather than at a

-- still arriving -- which used to mean every level after that was swallowed in
-- silence, `Game:openDraft` returning false and the run carrying on unasked.
--
-- These are what it is asked instead. One of them is small on purpose -- a few
-- percent, the size of number the catalogue *opens* a line with rather than the
-- one it ends on -- and there is no last one: the draft goes on offering them
-- for as long as the run goes on living. What a run buys past the catalogue is
-- not a new thing to do, it is more of what it already does, and saying that in
-- the size of the numbers is the honest way to say it.
--
-- They are kept out of `Upgrades.list` deliberately, and that is the whole of
-- how they stay out of the way. A line in that table is a candidate from the
-- first draft onwards, and three percent of nothing offered against a weapon on
-- level three would be a wasted card; `Loadout:roll` reaches for these only once
-- it has run out of real ones, which is exactly when they are worth anything.
--
-- The icons are the passive lines' own, reused rather than drawn again. An
-- endless line is not a new idea, it is an old one that refuses to stop, so the
-- icon saying which axis it pushes is the right thing for it to say -- and by
-- the time these come up the line each icon was borrowed from is finished and
-- out of the pool, so the two are almost never on a page together.
--
-- `forever(n)` is both the flag that says a line has no bottom and the thing
-- that builds the level it is asked for. It hands back the same { text, apply }
-- an authored level is written as, so nothing downstream has to know which shape
-- of line it is holding -- see `Upgrades.levelAt`.

-- Eight of them rather than one, because the draft lays down three cards and
-- three cards should still be a choice. One endless line offering the same thing
-- three times over would be a level-up you press through rather than answer,
-- which is the one thing every screen in this game is built not to be.
--
-- Eight covers twelve of the fifteen passive lines. Three of the numbers the
-- rest are made of are left out on a rule rather than by omission: **nothing
-- endless may multiply a number downwards.** The blotter's ink cost, the
-- cartridge's delay and the metronome's gap are those three, and a few percent
-- off any of them, taken for ever, converges on free ink that comes back
-- instantly and a page where everything fires every frame -- which is not an
-- upgrade to the meter or to the clock, it is neither of them being in the game.
-- The drawing half of this game is built on paying for what you put on the page
-- and the fighting half on waiting for the next beat, and an endless line is the
-- last place either should be quietly bought out. (The bandaid is the one line
-- with no endless answer for no reason at all: `mend` is an addition on a number
-- with no bad limit, so one could be written and simply has not been.)
--
-- Everything below is therefore additive, or a multiplier heading *up* from a
-- number with no bad limit, and there is no exception. There used to be one --
-- an endless fire rate, floored at four times the rate a run opens on, a floor
-- being the only honest way to write a downward line with no last level and an
-- admission that it should not have been one. The metronome above is that axis
-- back in the catalogue, where a line has a last level and 0.88 four times is a
-- number you can write down; it is deliberately not back out here.
