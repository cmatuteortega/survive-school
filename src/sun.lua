-- The sun coming up in the corner of the page.
--
-- The third passive weapon, and the one that belongs to the page you are
-- *looking at* rather than to the world drawn on it. A star is bolted to you
-- (src/orbital.lua) and a rocket leaves you (src/rocket.lua); both are
-- somewhere in particular, and both go where the fight is. The sun does not. It
-- rises in a corner of the screen, burns everything the disc covers while it is
-- up, sinks back out and comes up in a different corner -- so what it really
-- does is take a quarter of the page away from the horde for a few seconds at a
-- time, and tell you which quarter long before it matters. It is the one weapon
-- you play around rather than aim.
--
-- The disc is solid, and that is the design rather than an oversight: while the
-- sun is up you cannot read that corner, and the price of the safest place on
-- the page is not being able to see it. What walks back out is what tells you
-- what happened -- anything that stood in the light too long keeps a grey ghost
-- of its own outline for the rest of its life (Enemy:sunburn), so the page
-- remembers the burn.
--
-- Everything about it comes off the stat block the upgrade line built
-- (src/upgrades.lua): how wide, how hard, how long it stays and how long it is
-- gone, how far it swells while it burns, whether the opposite corner comes up
-- with it, and whether it throws sunrays across the page at full height. The
-- instance outlives being reconfigured, so a sun already up stays up and the
-- level that widens it widens the one you are standing in.
--
-- The two things it hits with ask two different questions, and the split is the
-- ordinary one. The disc covers ground -- eighty pixels of it, far wider than
-- the nine 12px cells `Game:eachNear` looks in -- so it asks `Game:eachWithin`,
-- the whole horde, affordable because it is asked twice a second on a tick
-- rather than every frame. A sunray in flight is a small thing at a point, like
-- a bullet or a rocket, so it asks the spatial hash exactly as they do.
--
-- It is the most expensive thing in the game to *draw*, and worth knowing why:
-- a filled disc is a span per row and its rim is eight pixels per step of the
-- circle, and three quarters of both are plotted off the page behind the corner
-- where nothing can see them. That is affordable at one or two suns up for a few
-- seconds at a time, and it is the price of drawing a circle on the same pixel
-- grid as everything else rather than letting love.graphics.circle put a smooth
-- polygon on the page. If it ever stops being affordable, the saving is to plot
-- only the quadrant that shows.
