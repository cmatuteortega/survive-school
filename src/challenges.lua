-- The homework: what the book asks you to go and do.
--
-- This used to be the collection's seventeen quests read out as a checklist, and
-- that was the same page twice. A quest is a **hole in the catalogue** -- it has a
-- shape, a price and a thing behind it -- and the library is the screen built to
-- show holes: an entry with its levels taken out, its name in graphite and its
-- demand in red. The one thing the library could not say was how far along you
-- were, so the homework page existed to say 3966/4000 and nothing else. That
-- meter now hangs under the demand where the demand is (src/library.lua), the
-- quests are read in the one place they were always about, and this page is free
-- to be the thing the book did not have.
--
-- Which is a list of **things you have done**, rather than of things you have
-- opened. The difference is the whole design:
--
-- - A quest is answered by your *best* run. It asks for four thousand kills on
--   one page or nine minutes in one sitting, and a book that only remembers its
--   best page can only ever ask you to have a better one.
-- - A challenge is answered by *every* run. FIFTY THOUSAND BLOBS is four hundred
--   afternoons and no single one of them; COMPLETE EVERY CLASS AT MASTERS is
--   seven wins nobody had in one evening. Neither is a number a maximum can
--   reach, which is why src/tally.lua exists at all.
--
-- **Nothing here unlocks anything, and that is deliberate.** Every reward in this
-- game is already a door -- a line in the catalogue, a page on the timetable, a
-- hero at the counter -- and each of those has a screen whose whole job is to say
-- what is behind it. A challenge that handed one over would be a second ladder
-- pointing at the same doors, and the first thing it would cost is the library's
-- promise that a shelf is the whole of what there is to open. So a challenge pays
-- in the only currency a checklist has: the box goes red. It is the part of the
-- book that is about the player rather than about the game.
--
-- **A row is a name, a ladder and a meter.** Three tiers is the usual shape --
-- five hundred, five thousand, fifty thousand -- and the row shows the lowest one
-- still standing, with a pip filled in for each that has fallen. One row, one
-- subject, however many rungs: the alternative is three rows saying BLOBS with
-- different numbers on them, which is a list you cannot run your eye down.
--
-- A row with one rung is an ordinary row with a short ladder (the four courses,
-- the four collections), and it needs no special case anywhere: what makes a row
-- long is how many numbers are in `want`.
--
-- **Four sections, stepped by the library's footer arrows**, because this list is
-- going to keep growing and a page is a page:
--
-- - **BESTIARY** -- one body count per row of `Enemy.types`. Per monster and not
--   one number over all of them, because a single ALL KILLS challenge is one
--   demand with ten prices and a run would learn to farm whichever page pays
--   fastest. Ten rows that each say something about a different part of the
--   horde say ten different things.
-- - **TERM** -- the boss count, the hours, and one row per rung of the ladder
--   (src/course.lua) asking for the whole timetable at that class or harder.
-- - **COLLECTION** -- the catalogue read as four sets rather than as eighty-one
--   lines: the tools, the weapons, the passives, and the drawings that are in
--   your own hand rather than the book's.
-- - **EVOLUTIONS** -- one row per tool, asking for every fusion built on it. The
--   library's own word for them, on the library's own terms: forty-five fusions
--   as forty-five rows would be four pages of homework, and ten rows of nine is
--   the same fact said in the order you actually fill it.
--
-- **Everything on all four is derived.** A new monster, a new lesson, a new rung
-- of the course ladder, a new tool, a new fusion and a new drawing board each
-- bring their own row and there is no list here to keep in step -- which is the
-- rule the whole extending section of CLAUDE.md is written along, and it matters
-- more here than anywhere: a homework list that fell out of step with the game
-- would be the book asking for something that does not exist.
--
-- **What it costs to add one that is not derived** is a row in the section it
-- belongs to: a `name`, a `want` ladder, a `have` that reads some register, and an
-- `ask` written as a phrase rather than a string (see below). Nothing else in the
-- game has to be told.

--- how a demand is written ----------------------------------------------------

-- A phrase is a key and what goes in its slots, never a finished string --
-- src/collection.lua's rule, kept here for src/collection.lua's reason: English is
-- the key (src/i18n.lua), so a demand built here and looked up later is a demand
-- looked up under words no dictionary has. `KILL 5000 OF THEM` is not a key,
-- `KILL %d OF THEM` is. The slot is filled after the translation, where it is
-- drawn (`I18n.say`).
local function phrase(key, a, b)
    return { key = key, a = a, b = b }
end

-- A stretch of time, written the way a stretch of time is read rather than as a
-- number of anything. Under an hour it is the clock every other screen in this
-- game writes (`9:00`); over one it grows an hours column and keeps going, so
-- fifty hours is `50:00:00` rather than three thousand minutes.
--
-- It goes into a slot as a string and comes back out of `I18n.t` unchanged, which
-- is that function's documented answer for anything it has no entry for -- and a
-- clock face has none in any language.

--- the bestiary ---------------------------------------------------------------

-- What a monster worth one experience point owes, and every other row on the
-- shelf is this divided by what one of *it* is worth.

-- be walking towards when everything else on this page is red.

-- you can hold in your head: two hundred skulls rather than a hundred and
-- sixty-seven. The rounding is what makes dividing the ladder legible at all --
-- without it the shelf would read as arithmetic somebody did rather than as a
-- demand somebody wrote.

-- number on a monster's row that already says how much of an event it is. So a
-- grin -- eight points, and the slowest thing in the game -- asks for sixty
-- rather than for five hundred, and the ladder says the same *sentence* on every
-- row instead of the same number: go and kill a great many of these.

-- The horde in the order it gets harder to kill, which is the one order this
-- table can be read in that means something and is not a second list: `hp`
-- ascending, with the row's own key breaking a tie so that two monsters of the
-- same toughness do not swap places between one build and the next (`table.sort`
-- in LuaJIT is not stable -- the library's shelves are sorted with the same
-- guard).
--
-- The boss is not on it. It has a row of its own in TERM, where what is counted
-- is a fight rather than a body, and a book that listed it here would be asking
-- for fifty thousand of the thing the whole game is built to make rare.
