-- The things you can buy, and what a run does with them.
--
-- Every other permanent thing in the save directory is either a *record* of what
-- happened (src/records.lua), a *thing you drew* (src/design.lua) or a *setting*
-- (src/options.lua). This is the fourth kind, and one of the two things the purse
-- is spent on: coins go in there and come out here, as lines you own a level of for
-- ever and spend a use of every run.
--
-- The other is three of the four heroes (src/characters.lua), which is the counter's
-- other section. The split between them is exactly the sentence below: a level here
-- is a *use*, and a level of a hero is a hero. What the two files have in common is
-- the five questions the canteen asks about a key -- `level`, `levels`, `priceOf`,
-- `canBuy`, `buy` -- and nothing else at all.
--
-- **A level is a use.** That is the whole of the arithmetic and it is deliberately
-- the same sentence twice: buying REROLL to level two means two rerolls in every
-- run from now on, and there is nothing else a level does. Which is what keeps
-- this out of src/upgrades.lua, where a level is written as a function of what it
-- changes and a line can sell four different things down its length -- here every
-- level of every line sells the same thing, one more of it, so the catalogue is
-- three rows of prices and nothing else.
--
-- **Where a use is spent is `spent` on the row**, and there are two answers to it.
-- Three of these are spent on the *draft* (src/levelup.lua) and one on the moment
-- the run would have ended, which is the whole of why the field exists: the draft
-- puts a button up for every line the run is carrying, and a button that pressed
-- would do nothing on that screen is a button that lies about what it is for. So
-- `spent` is read in exactly one place -- the draft's own button row -- and
-- everything else here goes on being a row with a price list on it.
--
-- The three drafts are written to be three different answers to *these three cards
-- are wrong*:
--
-- - **REROLL** asks again. Three more cards off the same catalogue, nothing spent
--   but the use.
-- - **SKIP** withdraws the question and sells the level back for coins
--   (`Purse.PER_SKIP`). The one perk that pays, and the only place in the game a
--   run turns something it earned into something the *book* keeps.
-- - **EXPEL** answers about one card rather than about the three: the line it
--   names is out of the run for good, and a fresh card takes its place. So it is
--   the only one of the three that needs a target, which is why it is the only one
--   that arms rather than acting on the press.
--
-- And the fourth is not about a draft at all:
--
-- - **RETAKE** is spent the frame the run would have ended. The hero gets up on
--   half a page of health with a couple of seconds nothing can touch him for
--   (`Player:revive`), and the run carries on with everything it had learned --
--   which makes it the first thing on this counter that changes how a run is
--   *played* rather than what it is offered. It is nobody's decision to spend, and
--   that is deliberate: a card asking whether to use your last life would be a
--   question with one sensible answer, and this book does not ask those. A run
--   holding one simply does not end yet, and the card that says so
--   (src/retake.lua) is an announcement rather than a question.
--
-- **Prices.** A run that reaches the eye is carrying four or five hundred kills,
-- so it pays two coins, maybe three or four. The rerolls and the expels are priced
-- off that -- a first one is a couple of runs, a full line is a dozen or so -- and
-- the SKIP line is priced off what it *pays* instead, which is the one thing here
-- that had to be argued about. Ten coins a skip is a whole run's kill payout two
-- or three times over, so a skip line priced like the other two would be bought
-- once and never cost anything again; priced at what three skips a run bring in
-- over a handful of runs, buying it is a bet on playing that way rather than a tap
-- that prints money. Move `Purse.PER_SKIP` and these move with it.
--
-- RETAKE is priced off neither, because what it sells is not a better draft but a
-- second run: a first one is most of an afternoon's coins and the second is dearer
-- than the whole reroll line. It is the top shelf of the counter on purpose -- the
-- three cheap lines are things you spend inside a run and this is the run itself,
-- so it should be the thing you are saving up for rather than the thing you pick
-- up on the way past. And it is **two levels rather than three**: the draft lays
-- three cards, which is what made three the natural length of a line spent on one,
-- and a run does not have three deaths in it -- two is already a run played twice
-- over, and a third would be a page nothing on it could close.
--
-- Written in src/purse.lua's shape: plain text in the save directory, a key and
-- one number a line, and a line the game cannot read costs that line its level
-- rather than the file. A perks file nobody can read is a book you have not spent
-- anything out of yet, which is the safe way for it to be wrong.
