-- The things the player draws rather than the game draws for them.
--
-- The hero is one, the star that orbits him is another and the rocket that
-- leaves him is a third, and they are the same thing at three sizes: a grid of
-- palette keys exactly as big as the sprite it becomes, so what is drawn on the
-- studio's board (src/studio.lua) is the sprite pixel for pixel -- nothing is
-- resampled, scaled or interpreted in between. Every change is pushed straight
-- into Sprites, which is what the rest of the game draws, so there is only ever
-- one of each: the hero the run walks, the title screen's doodle and the board's
-- life-size copy are one sprite, and so are the star on its orbit and the star
-- on the board it was drawn on.
--
-- A design is fixed at the size of the art it starts from, and that is the point
-- rather than a limitation: everything measured off a sprite -- the player's
-- radius, the star's reach -- would otherwise be at the mercy of what somebody
-- drew. You can change what a star looks like; you cannot draw a bigger one.
--
-- Each is written to its own file in the save directory and read back on the
-- next launch, so what you drew is still yours a week later. A file that has
-- been edited into something the game can't draw is ignored rather than trusted,
-- and you get back the one you were handed to draw over.

-- takes any of the eight, but only these three are on the board: three buttons
-- is a pencil case and eight is a paint set, and what a board is asking for is a
-- shape rather than a colour scheme.
--
-- Blue is the third because blue already means something in this game -- it is
-- the half of the palette that is yours, from the pen you draw walls with to the
-- bullets and the bomb's flash -- so a blue pixel on a
-- drawing reads as part of the thing rather than as a colour somebody picked.
-- Red is deliberately not offered: red is the horde's, and a hero drawn in it
-- would be the one mark on the page that lies about whose side it is on.

-- the board is the game: the first thing a run gives you is a blank grid and the

--
-- It is off for the player who has already drawn their sword and does not want
-- to draw it again -- a draft that stops the run dead on the board is a draft
-- that costs a hundred and fifty levels' worth of interruptions -- and it lives
-- here for the reason the language lives on I18n and the volumes live on Sfx
-- (src/options.lua): this is the module that knows what a board is. What it
-- governs is only the boards the game *opens for you* -- the weapon a draft has
-- just sold and the arm a character carries. `CUSTOM` on the timetable is a
-- board you went and asked for, and nothing may take that away.

--           drawing does not disappear because the game changed where it keeps
--           it. A list is tried in order, newest first
--   title   what the board calls it, under "DRAW YOUR"
--   hint    what the board says while it waits to be finished
--   walks   for something that stands on the page: the board's life-size copy
--           then gets the ground under it and the run's own walk bounce, and
--           something that floats gets neither
--   rim     for something drawn with a pale blue rim round it in the run: the
--           preview wears one too, so what the board shows is what floats past.
--           The cool S and the storm's bolt have one -- see Sprites.rim for why
--           they earn it, which is the same reason twice: a few thin strokes

--           picked there is what decides whether the board hands straight on to
--           another one (`design` in src/characters.lua)
--   turns   for something that points where it is going: the sprite is kept at
--           all eight headings rather than one (Sprites.turned). Only worth it
--           for something with a heading -- a hero and a star are drawn one way
--           up and stay that way -- and it is not free, since the four diagonal
--           headings are the one place in the game where a drawing is resampled
