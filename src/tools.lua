-- What you can draw with.
--
-- Every tool is the same object shape, so adding another is a matter of
-- appending a row here plus an icon in src/sprites.lua:
--
--   radius     how far from the stroke's centre line it can touch an enemy
--   damage     per hit
--   knock      knockback impulse applied away from the stroke
--   freeze     seconds a caught enemy is held in place (nil = never)
--   wall       solid: enemies steer around the line instead of crossing it --
--              filed at the tool's own radius by Walls:rebuild, whether the
--              line was laid by a hand or by a compass leg (the CORRAL below)
--   slick      slippery surface: {boost} for the player, {turn} for enemies
--   spacing    pixels between brush stamps along the path
--   smooth     how tightly the nib follows the pointer (nil = exactly)
--   ink        meter cost per pixel of line drawn (per drop, for a dropped one)
--   life       seconds the mark stays on the page after the stroke ends
--   ramp       colours the mark passes through as it fades, in order
--   fade       fraction of life before stamps start dropping out (dither)
--   rough      fraction of stamps missing from the off, for a broken mark
--   rehit      seconds before the same enemy can be hit again (nil = once)
--   linger     keep hitting enemies standing on the mark after it is drawn
--   tickRate   seconds between those ticks
--   stack      linger only: how many separate passes of one stroke may tick at
--              once over the same spot (nil = layers never stack). A pass is a
--              stretch of the path, so scribbling back over your own band is
--              what earns the extra layers -- see Stroke:lingerTick. Stacked
--              ink is visible: dabs laid back over the stroke's own ground are
--              drawn in the edge's colour (Stroke:draw), so where the layers
--              will bite is exactly where the band reads deeper.
--   graze      linger only: extra pixels of reach for the tick, over the ink's
--              own radius. For a mark that is also a wall, which is the pen's
--              contact level and the ring a compass carrying one rules:
--              Enemy:resolveWalls parks a body
--              at *exactly* the ink's edge, so a tick measured at the radius
--              alone would land or miss on floating-point luck. Two pixels of
--              slack is the difference between a fence that stings what leans
--              on it and one that stings whatever the arithmetic felt like.
--   pop        the mark does not fade quietly: on the frame its life runs out
--              it comes off the page all at once, and everything within
--              `reach` of the ink takes `damage`. The whole line rather than a
--              circle somewhere on it -- a fence has no centre -- see
--              Stroke:pop, called from Game:updateDrawing as the stroke is
--              culled.
--   keep       the marks of this tool are held on the page for as long as they
--              are the last ones laid: they do not age and they do not fade.
--              Laying another is what lets them go, and they are *let go*
--              rather than wiped -- they fade out on the life every other mark
--              gets. Marks rather than a mark, because one gesture is not
--              always one line: a compass carrying a pen (the CORRAL below)
--              rules its ring as one mark per leg and holds the pair of them.
--              See `Game:holdWalls`.
--   ignite     anything the mark covers catches fire: {time, tick, damage}.
--              The burn travels with the enemy and keeps ticking after it has
--              left the mark -- crossing the band is enough -- see
--              Game:updateBurning.
--   soften     freezing tools only: while this tool's hold has an enemy stuck,
--              everything that hits it hits this many times harder. Carried on
--              the enemy rather than read off the page -- see Enemy:hurt.
--   tear       freezing tools only: damage paid the moment the hold ends.
--              Coming loose is what costs, so it lands exactly once however
--              long the enemy sat there -- see Game:updateGlue.
--   pull       free enemies within `range` of the ink's edge are dragged
--              towards the nearest ink at `speed` px/s. See Game:updateGlue
--              and Stroke:pullTowards.
--   broad      a fatter nib for an upgrade to swap in: {radius, stamp, edge}.
--              Authored here rather than in src/upgrades.lua because what a
--              tool looks like is the tool's business; the level only says the
--              band gets it.
--   crit       a chance for any one hit to land far deeper: {chance, mult}.
--              Rolled per hit and announced when it lands -- see Stroke:apply
--              and Particles:crit. It means the same thing wherever it is
--              written, and it is written in two places now: on a brush, where
--              the stroke rolls it, and inside a `drop`, where what lands rolls
--              it (Staple:bite). A tool tapped dozens of times is the one place
--              in the game a one-in-five comes out as a rate rather than as a
--              story about that one staple.
--   flow       brushes only: the line gets cheaper the longer it runs without
--              the finger lifting. The cost per pixel eases exponentially from
--              the written price towards `floor` (a fraction of it, the cap
--              that keeps a long line from becoming free) over about `over`
--              pixels of line. Charged in Game:updateDrawing, reset with the
--              stroke.
--   under      drawn in the first pass, beneath every mark without it: for the
--              wide soft bands that would otherwise bury the thin lines laid
--              over them. See Game:draw.
--   lean       the tip keeps hitting where it rests while the stroke is held:
--              a zero-length segment at the head, every `rehit` seconds, held
--              back whenever the head is actually travelling. It is what lets
--              a tool that hits by being scrubbed be rested against something
--              instead -- and it is not free: {px} is what one resting hit
--              costs, in pixels of the tool's own ink, so the meter owns
--              leaning the way it owns drawing. Needs `rehit`. See
--              Stroke:update.
--   scrub      brushes only: what a pixel costs while the head is back over
--              ground this same stroke has already covered, as a fraction of
--              `ink`. A rub is back-and-forth by nature, so this discounts the
--              motion the tool is actually used with -- see Stroke:revisits.
--   pace       brushes only: the nib's weight follows the hand. Two nibs and one
--              threshold -- {over, thin} -- and which of them is on the page is
--              decided per dab, off how fast the *nib* was travelling when it
--              landed: at or above `over` pixels a second it is the thin one,
--              `thin` pixels of reach, and under that it is the row's own
--              `radius`. The nib and not the pointer, because `smooth` is what a
--              fast hand actually gets -- pricing the hand would sell the thin
--              line for a flick the nib never made.
--
--              It moves three things and they are one fact said three times: the
--              dab (`pacedStamp` below, since a stamp function is the only thing
--              in the drawing that ever sees an individual dab), the reach of the
--              hit (`Stroke:reach`), and the price by the pixel, which is the
--              ratio of the two nibs rather than a number of its own
--              (`Stroke:paceRate`) -- half as much ink on the page is half as
--              much out of the meter, and a row cannot say one thing about its
--              width and another about its cost. A mark whose width varies along
--              its own length also has to remember it, so the radius at each
--              recorded path point is kept beside the path (`pathR` in
--              src/stroke.lua): a tick off the finished line reaches as far as
--              the stretch of it the body is actually standing on, not as far as
--              the widest stretch somewhere else. What `ignite` tests is
--              deliberately the widest nib (Stroke:covers, Game:updateBurning) --
--              a burn is a body that touched the ink, and two pixels of slack
--              there is the pen's `graze` argument.
--   ram        what this tool's shove sends flying is itself a weapon while it
--              flies: {damage}. A launched enemy shoves and damages whatever
--              it runs into until its push speed drops back under the
--              threshold in Game:updateRams.
--   tap        the release reads this on a press that never went anywhere: a
--              radial hit at the point the finger landed on, {radius, damage,
--              knock, ram, ink, slack, hold}. `slack` and `hold` are what makes
--              it a tap -- how far the *finger* travelled in screen pixels and
--              how long the press lasted, both of them, and neither of them the
--              line: a finger held still while the player walks lays real world
--              line, so measuring the mark asks whether the page moved rather
--              than whether the hand did (Game:wasTap). `ink` is a flat price
--              like a tapped tool's, because that is what this is -- the one
--              gesture in the game a brush row can carry without giving up the
--              routing, since `drop` would beat the brush fields outright (see
--              the precedence list at the top of Game:updateDrawing) and a row
--              with both would never lay a line at all. `ram` means what it
--              means on the row above, and it is written in here rather than
--              out there so that the only shove hard enough to matter is the
--              one that reads it. See Stroke:tap, fired from the release branch
--              of Game:updateDrawing -- a press is not a tap until it has ended
--              without travelling, so nothing but the release can tell.
--   loop       close the line on itself and what is inside the ring is dealt
--              with once. Checked as the path is laid down; a close needs
--              real perimeter behind it and spends the path it used, so a
--              wiggle is not a lasso and a spiral has to keep travelling. See
--              Stroke:tryCloseLoop. A row where nothing is drawn by a hand
--              means the ring by something other than a path coming back to
--              itself -- a lap, for a compass (`Compass:ring`), or a circuit of
--              pins, for a row with `thread` below (`Game:stringThreads`) -- and
--              in both cases the mark the arm or the tap lays has `lassos`
--              cleared on it, because being surrounded happens once.
--
--              **What being ringed costs is three fields, and a row picks.**
--              `damage` is the pencil's own and the cheapest: everything inside
--              is cut once. `ignite` is a burn block ({time, tick, damage}) set
--              on everything inside instead, which is the marker's last level
--              delivered by the border rather than by contact (the BLEED below).
--              `lift` is {tick}: the ring is a hole in the page and goes on
--              taking what walks into it off the paper for as long as the mark
--              is on it, putting each one down again in the furthest clear corner
--              of the page -- the scissors' last level and the scissors' own
--              contract, `Game:liftEnemyTo`: a reposition, not a kill, so no
--              gem and no xp because nothing died (the CUTOUT).
--              A row may write more than one and they are independent; what none
--              of them may do is be assumed, which is why the walk in
--              `scaleDamage` asks for `loop.damage` by name before scaling it.
--
--              **And one field says the ring is drawn rather than only tested.**
--              `wash` floods the middle with the mark's own ink
--              (`Stroke:drawWash`), and `lift` lays rebaked page into it instead
--              (`Stroke:drawTorn`, called from the page layer in `Game:draw`
--              beside the offcut's own spans). Both walk the ring a row at a time
--              through `pixelart.fillPolygon`, and both use the same even-odd
--              test the hit is resolved with -- what is painted is exactly what
--              will be taken, which is the only reason a border is worth drawing
--              the inside of. A ring is kept on the stroke (`rings` in
--              src/stroke.lua) only by a row that writes one of these two.
--   fasten     a whole `drop` block on the row without being the row's block: what
--              a stroke drives into the page at its own two ends when the finger
--              lifts (the STITCH). It is the SEAM's `snap.wire` one storey out and
--              means the same thing -- a drop that something other than a tap is
--              pressing -- with the something being the stroke rather than a
--              straight edge. `ink` is the flat price of one, charged per staple
--              and refused rather than clamped; `slack` and `hold` are the tap
--              test above, and mean the same thing here. **The two ends go in at
--              the two moments**: the near one on the press, because a stapler
--              lands the instant you tap and putting a wind-up on the one tool
--              written without one stopped a tap feeling like a tap, and the far
--              one on the release if the finger actually travelled -- so a tap
--              fastens once because only one moment happened. See
--              Game:fastenEnds. `scaleDamage` and `scalePersistence` both reach
--              into it by name, as they do the wire.
--
--              **`tapped` reads the same test the other way round** (the SNAG):
--              nothing goes in at the press and nothing at the far end, and the
--              one staple lands *because* the finger never went anywhere. Which
--              is the whole of how a row can have a drop for one gesture and a
--              brush for the other: on that row the drag is a rub and a rub is
--              the thing that takes staples back out, so a press that fastened
--              first would put a staple at the head of every stroke and then tear
--              it straight out again. It also holds the mark's own hit back while
--              the press could still be a tap (`Stroke.touches`, set in
--              Game:updateDrawing) -- a stapler being pressed does not shove.
--   lift       {tick} -- **the ink itself is a severed region**: anything touching
--              this mark is lifted off the page and put down in the corner
--              furthest from you, on that clock, for as long as the mark is there
--              (`Stroke:sweepLine`, `Game:liftEnemyTo`). The scissors' finale with
--              a line for a shape, and the fourth shape one comes in after the
--              half-plane, the disc and the ring -- the first that is not an area,
--              and the only one that leaves the page underneath it whole. Same word
--              as `loop.lift` on purpose: that one lifts what a ring *encloses* and
--              this lifts what the line *touches*, which is one verb at two shapes.
--              No damage in it, so it may be written on the row (the PUNCH's rule)
--              and `scaleDamage` has no reason to reach it. One row (the DEADLINE),
--              and it is written with no `wall` beside it for a reason the row
--              spells out.
--   chord      a whole `cut` block on the row without being the row's block: the
--              page opened along the straight line between the mark's own two
--              ends when the finger lifts (the COLLAGE, the SCORCH). `fasten`'s
--              arrangement one shape over, and the rename is the whole point of
--              either field -- `cut` is in `Game:updateDrawing`'s precedence list,
--              so a brush row carrying one would *be* a pair of scissors and would
--              never lay a line. Every field a `cut` takes is read here too
--              (`Scissors.new` never learns which field it came out of), plus
--              `ink`, the flat price of one, refused rather than clamped and
--              undiscounted by the blotter for the STITCH's staples' reason.
--              See Game:chordCut.
--
--              **`tapped` turns the gesture over exactly as it does on `fasten`**
--              (the SHEAR): the two *taps* make the cut and the drag is the brush.
--              A row needs it when its mark has no two ends worth cutting between
--              -- a rub is an event that is nowhere once it is over -- and it is
--              the same field, read by the same `wasTap`, so it also wants the
--              `slack` and `hold` pair.
--   snag       this row's mark takes the page's own staples back out of it as it
--              travels: every one the stroke crosses is prised on the spot,
--              early, and its tear-out bite crits for certain (`Staple:snag`,
--              `Game:snagDrops`). A flag and nothing more -- what comes out, how
--              deep it bites and how it leaves are the drop's own numbers, and
--              only a drop whose module can be taken out of the page answers at
--              all, so a pushpin refuses without being named. It is also what
--              the rub's own two sounds read past the icon (Game:endStroke),
--              being only ever written on a row whose mark *is* a rub.
--   sting      what a *mark* does to whatever leans on it, where that is not what
--              the nib does going past. `damage` is one field and two tools may
--              write it meaning two different things: the DECKLE is a pencil
--              laying a pen's wall, so 9 is being drawn over and 1 is standing
--              against the finished fence. Read by Stroke:apply on a lingering
--              tick only, and defaulted to `damage`, so no other row changes.
--   thread     nothing here is drawn by a hand: it is *strung*, between two
--              things this same tool has already driven into the page. {reach}
--              is how far apart two of them may be and still be joined. Only a
--              row that also carries `drop` has any use for it, and today that
--              is five of the fusions off the pushpin at the foot of the list.
--              See Game:stringThreads.
--
--              **`reach` is what says whether this is a shape or a line**, and the
--              two numbers in the catalogue are 120 and 14 (`THREAD` and `LINK`
--              above). At the pushpin's range every pair of posts inside the reach
--              gets a rail, so a handful of taps is a shape you build. At the
--              stapler's a post can only see the next one in its own seam, so
--              thirty presses raked along a drag come out as one continuous mark --
--              which is `thread` and `rake` on the same row, a pairing no row had
--              before the stapler's three fusions and one that needed no new code
--              at all: a raked drop goes through Game:dropOne like a tapped one and
--              is stamped and strung exactly the same way.
--
--              **What gets strung is whatever else is on the row**, and that is
--              the same rule the blocks are routed by, one storey down. A row
--              with brush fields strings a Stroke built off them, laid whole on
--              the frame a drop lands -- so a `wall` thread is a fence between
--              two posts (the STOCKADE) and a `linger` one is a band strung
--              between them (the CORDON). A row with a second *block* strings
--              that instead, cast rather than pressed for, exactly as the FOLD's
--              `snap` is cast by two circles crossing: a `snap` is a ruler along
--              the line the two pins aim (the SNAP LINE) and a `cut` is the page
--              coming apart along it (the TEAR LINE). One field, three readings,
--              and the row picks between them by what else it carries.
--
--              **A strung mark is on the page for as long as both of its posts
--              are.** That is this field's own rule rather than any parent's
--              `keep`, and it is what makes the rows legible: a pin holds what
--              it caught for four seconds, so a shape built out of pins is on
--              the paper for as long as the pins are, and it begins ageing -- on
--              the tool's own `life`, down the tool's own `ramp` -- the moment
--              either end of it comes out. See `strung` in src/stroke.lua for
--              why that hold is not `kept`. It says nothing about a ruler or a
--              cut, and does not have to: those two land on the frame they are
--              cast and leave on their own block's clock, the way they do for the
--              tools they were taken from.
--   pool       the same idea at *one* post rather than between two: the brush is
--              laid as a single dab centred on the drop, on the frame it lands.
--              A flag and nothing more -- how wide the dab is is the brush's own
--              `radius`, as it is everywhere else -- and the two rows that carry
--              it write that radius at the crater's own 25, because a pool is not
--              a nib: it is what filled the hole, so it is as wide as the hole.
--              See Game:poolAt.
--
--              **One stamp is the whole mark, and two fields have to know it.**
--              The dither that takes a mark off the page drops *stamps*, and a
--              fraction of one stamp is either all of it or none -- so a pooled
--              row writes `fade = 1` and fades down its ramp alone, or it would
--              vanish at a random moment in its last half. `edge.rough` is the
--              same arithmetic on the rim and goes the same way. Both are in the
--              TACK's row where they were paid for.
--   margins    a ruled row only: the mark this row carries is laid down *both*
--              long edges of the band rather than along its centre line, which
--              is the pair of dashed lines a ruler's aim has always drawn made
--              real (the MARGIN, `Ruler:drawGuide`, `Game:trailRuler`). On the
--              row rather than in the block because it says where the *mark*
--              goes, which is the mark's business; `edge` one line down is the
--              brush's own rim and the two have nothing to do with each other.
--   stamp      draws one brush dab in the currently set colour. A brush may
--              have none, in which case it leaves no mark at all -- see crumbs
--   edge       second pass drawn underneath the core: {stamp, color, rough}
--   holes      third pass drawn over the top of it, same shape as edge
--   speck      particles thrown off while drawing: {chance, color}
--   crumbs     debris rubbed off the tip instead of a mark, thrown out to the
--              sides of the stroke rather than every way at once: {chance,
--              color}, chance per stamp step
--
-- Five of the tools are not brushes at all, and none of them draws a line, so
-- none of the fields above describe them. Each carries one of four blocks
-- instead -- the block says how the tool is *used*, not what it is -- and for
-- all of them `ink` is the flat price of one use rather than a cost per pixel:
--
--   drop   placed. A tap puts one where you tapped: {lands, radius, damage,
--          freeze, life}. `lands` is the module that turns up on the page, and
--          it is the only thing separating the pushpin from the stapler --
--          those two are used in exactly the same way, so they share the block
--          and the code path, and differ in what arrives and by how much. See
--          src/pin.lua and src/staple.lua. A row where the block is not the
--          gesture may add `sprite`, the name of what the thing is seen being
--          carried as: the SPINDLE's leg has a pushpin on the end of it rather
--          than a lead, and Compass:drawLeg draws that instead. The pin's upgrade line adds three
--          more, all resolved in Pin:land: `point` multiplies the hit on the
--          one body the point itself came down on, `refund` gives {frac} of
--          the price back when {count} or more were under the circle, and
--          `drive` is damage per kill added to the hit on the survivors.
--
--          The stapler's line adds three of its own. `crit` is the field above,
--          rolled by what lands rather than by a stroke. `prise` is the one that
--          changes the *ending*: instead of the page keeping the staple when its
--          hold runs out, the wire is torn back out of the paper, biting a second
--          time on the way and leaving nothing behind -- see src/staple.lua and
--          the `lifted` branch of Game:updateDrops. And `rake` is {every}, the one
--          field here that changes the *gesture*: while the pointer is held
--          another one lands every `every` pixels it travels (Game:rakeDrops), so
--          a tapped tool becomes a dragged one.
--
--          A fusion adds a fourth, and one row carries it (the CLINCH). `tacky`
--          is seconds between *catches*: everything standing in the circle is
--          stuck to the wire again, on that cadence, for as long as the staple is
--          in the page -- which is the gluestick's own contract (a hold
--          re-applied rather than a hold handed out once) on a fastener instead of
--          on a smear. A catch is not a bite: no damage and no crit, because a
--          staple that hit everything on it every four tenths of a second would be
--          a weapon and this is a fastener. What it costs the crowd is that it is
--          still standing there when the wire comes out. See `Staple:catch`.
--
--          It is also the one thing in the game that hands a *block* to
--          `Enemy:freeze` as the thing doing the sticking, which is how a run's
--          `soften` beside it rides on the body rather than on the wire
--          (`Enemy:hurt`) -- a staple's hold has always passed nothing, and this is
--          the exception the comment there names.
--
--          `rake` is the one of the stapler's three a *fusion* writes as well, and
--          the VOLLEY below is it: the same field, the same code, at four and a half
--          times the price and four times the spacing, because what the field
--          says is "this gesture is a drag" and that is true of a pin exactly as
--          it is true of a staple. One more field is written by that row and by
--          nothing else -- `instant` takes the pushpin's fall off, so the crater
--          lands on the frame you tap it. It is the one flag in the catalogue
--          that removes a telegraph rather than adding an effect. See `Pin.new`,
--          which reads it beside the flag a compass leg sets.
--   snap   aimed. Press and it pivots about the player, release and it comes
--          down: {length, width, damage, knock, life, ramp, fade}. See
--          src/ruler.lua. A row where the block is not the gesture means
--          something else by it, exactly as `drop` does: the FOLD's is the ruler
--          two of its own circles cast between their crossings
--          (`Compass:crease`), which is the one block in the catalogue nobody
--          ever presses for. Its `length` goes unwritten there, because the chord
--          decides how far it reaches and a number nothing reads is a number that
--          would lie -- see the row.
--
--          The ruler's own family of fusions adds three, and all three are about
--          the *line* rather than about the ruler, which is why they are here and
--          not on the row. `wipe` takes the band off: what the block reaches is
--          every body within the ruler's own length of the line rather than within
--          its width, so a straight edge ruling the whole page parts the whole page
--          (the PARTING). It is the compass's field of the same name in the other
--          block and it means the same thing -- what a block reaches, not by how
--          much. `wire` is a whole `drop` block one level in: what the straight edge
--          presses into the page as it comes down, one every `rake.every` pixels
--          of the line (the SEAM). It is inside the block rather than on the row
--          because `drop` and `snap` are the one pair in the catalogue that borrow
--          each other's gesture in both directions and a precedence list cannot say
--          so -- see the note at the top of `Game:updateDrawing`. The first is read
--          by `Ruler:strike` and the second by `Game:trailRuler`, and the row's own
--          `margins` below is the third of the set.
--   sweep  opened. Press and the needle goes into the page there, drag to open
--          it out to the width you want, release and it swings: {minR, maxR,
--          width, damage, knock, turn, life, ramp, fade}, plus the three the
--          upgrade line moves -- `laps` times round (`turn` is seconds for one
--          of them), `bite` times the damage over the first `biteArc` radians of
--          each lap, and `counter` for a second leg going the other way. One
--          fused row (the PUNCH) also carries `sever` -- {tick} for the
--          disc the closed ring takes off the page, which is the scissors' own
--          last level with a circle round it instead of a half-plane, and the
--          only thing a sweep does to the middle of its own circle. Another (the
--          SPINDLE) carries `drive`, damage per kill added to what the point
--          reaches next, and a `drop` block beside the sweep saying what the leg
--          is carrying. Three rows carry a second block now and no two of them
--          mean the same thing by it: what the leg is holding (the SPINDLE), what
--          it works as it travels (the HEM), and what the circle it drew casts
--          when a second circle crosses it (the FOLD).
--          `width` is the ruler's and the scissors' word for the same thing --
--          how far off the line a body's centre may be before its own radius
--          stops reaching -- and here the line is the *rim*: what a compass cuts
--          is the circle it draws and never the middle of it. See
--          src/compass.lua.
--   cut    tapped twice. The first tap anchors, the second says which way it
--          goes, and the page opens along the line between them: {reach, width,
--          damage, knock, life, ramp, fade}. The only block whose gesture spans
--          more than one press, and so the only one whose `ink` is charged by
--          the second tap rather than the first -- unless the blades are carrying
--          wire, and then it is charged by both (see `wire` below) -- and the only
--          one that does
--          not land the moment it is paid for, since the blades then travel the
--          length of that line rather than closing along all of it at once. See
--          src/scissors.lua and Game:openCut. Its upgrade line adds three more, all resolved in
--          Scissors: `blades` is {damage, width} for the stretch between the two
--          taps, which from then on is worth more than the rest of the cut the
--          way the compass's `bite` is worth more than the rest of a lap -- and
--          it is deliberately not called `bite` too, since that one is a bare
--          multiplier and scaleDamage walks these blocks by field name;
--          `through` runs the cut on past both taps to the edges of the page;
--          and `sever` is {tick} for the half of the page the cut takes
--          off it, the one thing in the game that writes into the *page* layer
--          rather than onto it. It takes one more field, and only one row writes
--          it: `follows` makes the cut re-read which half you are standing on
--          every frame instead of freezing it at the tap, which is what a cut
--          ruled through your own feet needs and what nothing else does (the
--          GUILLOTINE below, `Scissors:takeSides`).
--          Two more are read by fused rows only and both are nil everywhere else:
--          `ignite` is a burn block ({time, tick, damage}) set on whatever the
--          blades cut and survive it, which is the marker's finale delivered by a
--          pair of scissors (the SCORCH, `Scissors:strike`); and `sever.paste` is
--          seconds of glue laid on whatever the offcut carries into the corner,
--          which is the gluestick's (the COLLAGE, `Scissors:lift`). The second is
--          the only thing in the game done to a body by the region that *moved* it
--          rather than by the ground it landed on.
--          One fused row adds a fourth (the HINGE): `wire` is a whole `drop`
--          block one level in, exactly as the SEAM's is inside `snap`, and it is
--          the same wire read against a different line -- a staple where each tap
--          landed and the stretch between them filled at `rake.every` pixels
--          (Game:openCut, Game:closeCut, Game:seamAlong). It is inside the block
--          rather than on the row for the SEAM's reason: a `drop` on the row
--          *would* be the gesture, and this one is what the blades are carrying --
--          see the note at the top of `Game:updateDrawing`. It is also the one
--          field in the game that moves where a price is charged, because a tap
--          that drives a staple is not the free anchor the parent's rule was
--          written about.
--
-- **A row may carry more than one shape**, and most fusions at the foot of the
-- list do. Thirteen are a brush and a block at once: four a brush and a sweep --
-- the HALO, the LASSO, the MOAT and the CORRAL -- four a brush and a *snap*, which
-- is the newest of the three families -- the MARGIN, the SPINE, the UNDERLINE and
-- the TRENCH -- and five a brush and a `drop`: DOT TO DOT, the STOCKADE, the
-- CORDON, the TACK and the CRATER. Six carry *two blocks* apiece -- the SPINDLE,
-- the HEM, the FOLD, the SNAP LINE, the TEAR LINE and the GUILLOTINE. And five
-- carry a single shape, every one of them for a reason worth reading rather than
-- because there was nothing to add: the PUNCH and the CLEARING are a sweep and
-- nothing else, because the scissors' half of one and the rubber's half of the
-- other live entirely inside the block; the PARTING and the SEAM are a snap and
-- nothing else for the same two reasons one family over, the rubber's shove being
-- a field on the block and the stapler's wire being a block *inside* it; and the
-- VOLLEY is a `drop` and nothing else, because both of its parents are already
-- that block and what it fuses is the block's own fields. The rule that makes all
-- of them work
-- is the same one and it never had to change: the block tested first is the
-- gesture, and whatever else is on the row is what the arm is carrying. Nothing had to be
-- taught that -- the press is routed on field presence and the blocks are tested
-- before the brush fields (Game:updateDrawing), so a row with a block is used as
-- that block, and its brush fields are simply there for whatever wants them.
-- What wants them here is the compass: a leg carrying a nib rather than a lead
-- drags a Stroke round behind it built off this same row (src/compass.lua), so
-- the mark it leaves is the brush written above, laid by the arm instead of by
-- your hand. That is what a *fusion* is made of (`needs` and `fuses` in
-- src/upgrades.lua): two finished lines both still doing exactly what they always
-- did, at once. And what the brush fields are is not always an attack: the
-- CORRAL's are the pen's, so the mark the arm leaves is *terrain* -- a wall with
-- no ends, laid where your hand is not, which is both of the things the pen has
-- never been able to do. The first nine are that same compass wearing
-- something else -- bar one, and the FOLD is worth reading for it: nothing is on
-- the arm there at all, and the tool's second half is a thing that happens
-- *between two marks* on the page.
--
-- **And then the pushpin, which is the second thing on the strip worth borrowing
-- a gesture from, and the reason the paragraph above used to end differently.**
-- It said the nine were all the compass because the compass is the only tool
-- that reaches away from you. That was half right. A pin also lands wherever you
-- tapped and never where your hand is -- what a pin has never had is a **line**.
-- It is a point, and a point cannot be a shape, a fence or a band however far off
-- you put it. So the rows at the foot of the list are the compass's argument
-- through the mirror: there, a gesture that reached borrowed a nib and its *ring*
-- became a mark; here, a gesture that reaches borrows a nib and the *pins* become
-- one.
-- Nothing about the tap changes -- it is the pushpin's tap, the pushpin's
-- quarter-second fall and the pushpin's crater -- and then a second pin dropped
-- near the first is joined to it by whatever nib the fusion ate (`thread` above,
-- Game:stringThreads). One field, and it is the same field on five of the eight
-- rows: what makes DOT TO DOT a shape, the STOCKADE a fence, the CORDON a strip of
-- burning page, the SNAP LINE a ruled diameter and the TEAR LINE a page in two is
-- only what is written beside it, exactly as the compass's nine differ only in what
-- is in the leg. Two more carry `pool` instead, which is the same idea at one
-- pin rather than between two -- because two of those parents are not line tools,
-- and you do not string paste between two points.
--
-- **And then the eighth, which is neither, and which is the one row that breaks
-- the sentence three paragraphs up.** "Nothing about the tap changes" is true of
-- all seven above: they are the pushpin's tap, the pushpin's quarter-second fall
-- and the pushpin's crater, with something new happening near the pin afterwards.
-- The VOLLEY changes only the tap, and nothing happens near the pin at all.
--
-- Which is the pushpin fused with the one tool on the strip that shares its
-- gesture. Everywhere else in this family the second parent brings a *nib* or a
-- second block -- something the pin has never had -- and the pin brings the reach.
-- Here both parents are already a `drop`, so there is no nib to borrow and no
-- shape to string: the two rows differ in nothing but the numbers and flags inside
-- one block, and the fusion is those two sets of fields laid over each other. It
-- is the only fusion in the game that is one block deep, and it is why what it
-- fuses -- a `rake`, a `crit`, and the fall taken off -- are fields on the block
-- rather than shapes on the row.
--
-- **And then the ruler, which is the third gesture worth borrowing from and the
-- one the other two had already borrowed *first*.** The FOLD casts a ruler
-- between two compass circles and the SNAP LINE casts one between two pins, so by
-- the time these seven rows were written the ruler had been on the receiving end
-- of both families and had never once been the tool doing the fusing. Which is
-- odd, because it is the only gesture on the strip that is *aimed*: a brush goes
-- where your hand goes, a pin and a cut go where you tapped, a compass opens
-- where you pressed, and a ruler is the one thing you point.
--
-- What it points is a line through your own feet, and that is the tool's whole
-- limitation -- you choose which way the page is swept and never where. The two
-- fusions cast *at* it are both answers to that sentence: the FOLD sells the reach
-- to buy the position and the SNAP LINE keeps the reach and pays in precision.
-- These seven leave the limitation exactly where it is and answer the other
-- complaint, the one nobody had written down: **a ruler's mark does nothing.**
-- Everything within the band is hit once and thrown clear of the line to both
-- sides, and what that leaves is a corridor across the page with a ruled pencil
-- line down the middle of it -- and the corridor closes the moment the crowd walks
-- back in, because a pencil line is not terrain, not fire, not paste and not a
-- fence. The ruler opens a lane and has never been able to keep one.
--
-- So the second parent is what gets left in the lane. Nothing about the gesture
-- changes -- the press pays, the pivot follows you, the drag turns it, the release
-- lands it, and the band comes down at the finished ruler's 13 across and 210 of
-- shove -- and then whatever else is on the row is ruled along the line it landed
-- on (`Game:trailRuler`). Two graphite lines down the band's own edges, a fence,
-- a burning band, a bar of paste, a seam of wire, the page opened, or -- for the
-- one parent that leaves nothing on paper at all -- the page itself parting. It is
-- the compass's argument in a straight line: there a gesture that reached borrowed
-- a nib and its *ring* became a mark, here a gesture that spans borrowed one and
-- its *reach* did.
--
-- **Every one of them is the whole page**, which is the ruler's own finale doing
-- the work rather than a decision taken seven times. "IT RULES THE WHOLE PAGE END
-- TO END" is half a screen diagonal, the only number in the game measured off the
-- window, so a finished ruler already lands corner to corner and a fusion built on
-- a finished ruler cannot land any other way. That is what makes the family read
-- as one idea from the strip: whatever this row is carrying, you are about to draw
-- it across the entire page, through yourself, in one press.
--
-- **And two of them do not shove**, which is the family's one real interaction and
-- is worth knowing before writing an eighth. A held body drops the push it was
-- carrying (`frozen` in Enemy:update), so a ruler that fastens is a ruler that does
-- not open anything: the TRENCH's paste and the SEAM's wire both catch what the
-- band caught and hold it exactly where it was standing. Which is the gluestick
-- and the stapler being themselves rather than a rule breaking -- neither has ever
-- shoved anything, and both rows say so.

-- How far apart two pins may be and still be joined (`thread` above), and one
-- table rather than five copies of the number: what a thread reaches is a fact
-- about the *gesture* and not about the nib on the end of it, so raising it raises
-- it for a graphite line, a fence, a burning band, a ruled diameter and a tear at
-- once. Which is what the field was for -- it is a table rather than a bare number
-- so that a row has somewhere to disagree, and so far none of them wants to.
--
-- **It was 50, then 80, and both were too tight.** 50 had a lovely argument -- a
-- finished pin punches 25 about the point, so two pins fifty apart are two craters
-- whose rims are exactly touching, which meant the tool drew its own range and no
-- guide was needed. It did not survive playing, and neither did the compromise
-- after it. Three taps inside a fifty-pixel circle is a shape you build by
-- accident or not at all: a pin costs half a meter and holds for four seconds, so
-- the second and third of them are placed in a hurry, and a range that small turns
-- every one of the five tools into a thing that mostly does not go off. A fusion
-- should not have a knack.
--
-- **120 is the number that stops it being one.** It is three eighths of the
-- narrowest page the game is ever drawn on, where 50 was a sixth and 80 a quarter,
-- and the difference is what a *triangle* costs: three pins pairwise inside 80
-- have to sit in a circle 46 across, which is a shape you have to plan, where at
-- 120 they sit in one 69 across and the shape is one you can simply mean. That
-- matters more than the reach itself, because four of the five threading tools are
-- only interesting closed -- DOT TO DOT cuts what it encloses, the STOCKADE is a
-- fence you want a corner in, and the CORDON is a band you want to walk somebody
-- into. A range that makes a straight line easy and a triangle hard is a range
-- aimed at the wrong half of the family.
--
-- What every step up costs is the arithmetic that used to draw the range for free:
-- the rims are seventy pixels apart at full stretch now, so there is a lot of
-- clear page between two pins that are still going to be joined. **So it is
-- drawn.** Every pin still holding shows a graphite ring at this radius, which is
-- the same pencil circle the pin already draws while it is falling, several sizes
-- up -- see the page pass in Game:draw. The ring is on the page for exactly as
-- long as the pin can still be linked, so it is the range and the clock in one
-- drawing, and a range you can see is worth more than an arithmetic coincidence
-- you cannot. At this radius the ring is also most of the reason the tool is
-- readable at all: 120 is far enough that two pins can be joined without looking
-- to a player as though they ought to be.
--
-- Shared and read-only for PIN's reason.

-- The same field at the other end of its own range, and the three stapler fusions

-- every twelve pixels (`rake`), so a reach of fourteen joins each one to the one
-- before it and to nothing else: the mark follows the seam instead of latticing it.
--
-- **That is the difference between the two numbers said as a shape.** At 120 a
-- handful of taps is a *shape you build* -- a triangle, a Y, a spur off the fence
-- you laid ten seconds ago -- and every pair inside the reach gets a rail, which is
-- what the pushpin's family is. At 14 thirty presses are a *line you drag*, and the
-- rail is the seam itself. Same function, same code (Game:stringThreads), and the
-- only thing that changed is how far a post can see.
--
-- It also has to be under twice the spacing or the seam would lattice itself: at 25
-- every staple would rail to the one two along as well, and a fence would come out
-- doubled down its whole length. Fourteen leaves eleven pixels of slack under that
-- ceiling and two over the spacing, which is enough that a hand raking a curve

-- level, 12 is the second, and the 210 shove and the ruled pencil line it leaves
-- are the row it was always written on. Shared and read-only on PIN's terms --
-- Tools.copy lifts every block onto the run's own copy before a single upgrade
-- level or multiplier sees it, so what gets scaled is never this, and so is what
-- the two rows that write into their own snap on the way past write into.
--
-- **`length` is written down, and that one field is the whole difference between
-- the two things a cast can mean.** `Ruler.cast` reads it where the FOLD leaves it
-- out: with it, two points *aim* the line and the reach is the tool's own, so the
-- ruler runs on past both of them to the corners of the page; without it, the two
-- points are the ends and the gap between them is the reach. Which is why the FOLD
-- is the one ruler in the catalogue that does not use this table -- a chord is as
-- long as the chord is, and a number here would be read by nothing and would say
-- something false about the tool to anybody reading the row.
--
-- The 165 is a placeholder for the run's own screen. Every line that unlocks one
-- of these overwrites it with half a diagonal every rebuild (`rulesThePage` in
-- src/upgrades.lua), which is the ruler's own finale and the only number in the

        -- one fusion where the honest comparison is not "what the two tools cost
        -- cast one after the other": a full meter of gluestick draws ninety pixels
        -- of smear, and this lays eight hundred. What the fusion sells is not a

        -- blades in the leg and the offcut stops being half the paper and becomes
        -- a disc you sized with the drag.

        -- **Two numbers the parents already agree on**, which is the clearest
        -- sign yet that a fusion is the right pair. `width` is 3 on both, and the
        -- compass's own block says why in as many words -- it took the scissors'
        -- number for the scissors' reason, because a lead is a point and a blade
        -- is an edge and neither reaches off the line it rules. `damage` is 12 on
        -- both, arrived at twice from opposite arguments: the scissors' 12 is the
        -- skull's whole health along a line nothing is standing on unless you put
        -- it there, and the compass's 12 came from the level that stopped the

        -- 0 is written down rather than left out precisely so that no multiplier

        -- something that is moving, and the whole skill of it is landing a 15px
        -- circle on a body that will not stand still. Its finale sells the ten
        -- presses back as one gesture -- but a dragged seam is still a seam your
        -- own hand has to walk, in a straight-ish line, through the crowd you
        -- wanted it in front of. The compass is the only tool that reaches away
        -- from you and the only one that draws a closed line. So the seam is laid

        -- eleven pixels of bat, "what stops a tap on a moving target from being a
        -- certainty" -- and every word of that is true and is exactly what a

        -- a moving target is no longer a lead you have to guess. It is also what
        -- makes the drag below possible at all: a raked pin with a quarter-second
        -- fall would land a quarter of a second behind your finger, which is a
        -- seam laid where you *were*.
        --
        -- **`rake`** is the gesture, and it is the stapler's finale unchanged --
        -- the one level in the catalogue that turns a tap into a drag, working
        -- here through exactly the same `Game:rakeDrops` it works through there.
        -- A tap still lands one pin, and that matters: the tool is the pushpin
        -- until you hold the pointer down, so nothing about the way you already
        -- used it is taken away. Hold and drag and it rakes a seam of craters.
        --
        -- 48 apart against the staple's 12, which is the stapler's own written
        -- rule read at this size: there `every` is set so the circles just
        -- overlap at a 7px bite, and here it is set so they just overlap at a
        -- 25px one. So the seam is a chain of holes rather than a stripe, no body
        -- is inside two craters at once, and the pin's "kills everything caught
        -- but the tank" survives per crater exactly as written. A meter is four
        -- pins, so a drag is about 145 pixels of seam, 51 wide.
        --
        -- **`crit`** replaces the pin's `point`, and that swap is the whole
        -- argument of the fusion rather than a balance decision. Both are a
        -- multiplier on one hit; they differ in what decides it. `point` doubles
        -- the body the point itself came down on -- a level about *aim*, and it
        -- cannot survive a tool whose gesture is a drag: what you choose in a
        -- seam is a line, and which body each 48-pixel step happens to land its
        -- point on is luck. Writing it here would be a level that pays out on the
        -- one press in a rake that is still a tap. `crit` triples on a roll
        -- instead, and a roll works identically on a tap and on the fortieth pin
        -- of a seam. Which is the trade the two tools' own upgrade lines have
        -- already argued out: the stapler's says a one-in-five is only a *rate*
        -- if the sample is large, "where the same roll on a pin you get two of
        -- from a full meter would only ever be a story about one pin". Four a
        -- meter, raked, is the sample that makes it a rate. **The drag is what
        -- makes the crit legitimate**, and the crit is what pays for the aim the
        -- drag gave up.
        --
        -- What survives from the pin is `radius`, `damage`, the freeze/life pair
        -- and `drive` -- and `drive` is where a seam pays off in a way a tap never
        -- could. It is the pin's own finale, converting kills under a circle into
        -- weight on that circle's survivors, and its row is careful that "a pin
        -- dropped on a *lone* skull changes nothing at all". A rake is how you
        -- get a crowd under a circle on purpose. Nothing here doubles up -- the
        -- craters do not overlap -- so what a seam does to a grin is hit it once

    -- fused brush is two rows averaged: a nib of some middle width in a colour
    -- neither parent uses, doing a bit of both jobs, and the honest thing to say
    -- about it is that a run holding one could not tell you what it had.

    -- rule off the arm and onto the page: **one parent's mark is the body, and the
    -- other parent is what happens at it.** Which one is the body is not a
    -- preference -- it is whichever parent's mark is a *place*. A pen line is
    -- terrain, a marker band is a surface, and both of those are somewhere a body
    -- can be; a rub is an event that happens to whatever is under the tip and is
    -- nowhere at all once it is over. So the pen writes the body twice here and the
    -- marker writes it once, and the rubber -- which is nobody's body, in either of
    -- the pairs it is in -- writes what the place does to whatever comes to it.
    --
    -- **And when the second parent cannot be what happens at the place, it becomes
    -- the other gesture.** That is the STUB's shape and the SCUFF below is the
    -- second row in the game to take it: a rub delivered *by* a band would either
    -- be the band shoving, which is a band nobody can stand on, or the nib shoving
    -- as it goes past, which is a rubber that has to be scrubbed and is a rubber
    -- already. Tap and drag are two gestures and the release can tell them apart

        -- motion, and the pooled-ink colour that is supposed to be the map of it
        -- would be most of the mark.
        --

    -- Nine pairs were left over after those and every one of them is a brush with a
    -- *block* -- a tool with no line in it at all -- which is the wall the family
    -- was always going to hit. You cannot make the stroke the carrier when one
    -- parent has no stroke.
    --
    -- **So the carrier goes back to being the gesture, and what is new is which
    -- one.** The stapler is the only block on the strip whose gesture is a *drag*:
    -- `rake` is its finale and it lays a staple every twelve pixels for as long as
    -- you hold. That is a path across the page, laid by a hand, at a fixed spacing
    -- -- which is a stroke in everything but name, and it is the thing these rows
    -- borrow. Two of them hang a mark off it (`thread` with `LINK`'s fourteen-pixel
    -- reach, so each staple rails to the next one and to nothing else) and the
    -- third puts paste on the wire instead.
    --
    -- Which makes them the pushpin's threading family with one number changed, and
    -- the pair is worth reading together: at the pin's 120 a handful of taps is a
    -- *shape you build*, and at the stapler's 14 thirty presses are a *line you
    -- drag*. Same field, same function, same code. The STOCKADE and the CORDON are
    -- the shapes; the PALING and the WICK are the lines.
    --
    -- **The first three ask for a finished SELLOTAPE**, which the twelve above do not, and
    -- the switch back is the honest one. The ink lines were the right catalyst for
    -- rows a hand draws -- every one of the twelve is priced by the pixel, and the
    -- meter is the only thing between a brush and the whole page. Not one of these
    -- three is priced by the pixel: they are priced by the press, ten to a meter,
    -- exactly as their parent is. (The fourth is priced *both* ways, which is what
    -- sends it to a different line -- see the SNAG.) What the tape pays a run for is
    -- *time*, which is what a run that put ten levels into two tools has been
    -- spending, and it is
    -- given back untouched on its own terms.
    --
    -- RUBBER + STAPLER is the fourth, and it is the one this family could not write
    -- for a long time. The trouble was real: a rub is an event at a point and a
    -- staple is a fastener at a point, so a *seam* of them is either two things
    -- happening in the same place or -- worse -- a shove that undoes the fastening it
    -- was raked beside. Both readings are a row arguing with itself.
    --
    -- What settled it is that the second reading is not a bug, it is the tool. If a
    -- rub undoes a fastening then the rub is what *takes the staple out*, and the
    -- stapler already had a level about the wire coming out and biting on the way
    -- (`prise`). So the seam was the wrong carrier and the answer was the STUB's:
    -- a gesture each. See the SNAG at the foot of this family.

        -- them at the stapler's own twelve-pixel spacing, so the line the blades

        -- kill what you lined up. This answers it by making the line *hold*: every
        -- staple is 6 through a 7px circle with one in five going straight through
        -- at 18, and it pins whatever it catches to the paper for two seconds. The
        -- blades take a beat to travel (Game:updateCuts), and what they arrive at

        -- that stops things moving and the scissors are the tool that needs things
        -- to stand still; nothing about that had to be invented.
