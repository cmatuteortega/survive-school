-- Which hero the run is played as.
--
-- A subject is a page and a tool (src/subjects.lua); a character is the other
-- half of that question, and it is asked on the board rather than on the
-- timetable because it is a question about the drawing. The stick man you draw
-- is *who* you play; this is *what he opens the run holding*, and the two are
-- picked in the same breath -- the arrows under the boxes in the studio
-- (src/studio.lua), stepped rather than scribbled for, because choosing which
-- kind of hero to look at is no more a question than choosing which tab of the
-- timetable to look at is.
--
-- There are four, and each one is a different opening question about where the
-- fight happens. The shootman picks things off a third of the page away and the
-- swordsman has to be inside the crowd -- opposite halves of one idea, and the two
-- the game was built on. The starman opens with nothing that shoots at all: a star
-- turning round him, so what he has is a ring rather than a reach. The skateman
-- opens with a surface -- a trail that cuts whatever follows him down it -- so
-- what he has is only ever the ground he has just left, and standing still is the
-- one thing he cannot do.
--
-- None of them is a stat block dressed up. What changes is where you have to
-- stand, which is the only thing in this game a character could change and still
-- be the same run.
--
-- **One of the four is the book's and the other three are bought.** The swordsman
-- is the hero every book opens with -- the plainest of them, standing inside the
-- crowd with a sword, which is the run this game was written around -- and the
-- other three are rows on the canteen's counter (src/canteen.lua) at the same
-- price apiece. The same price on purpose: the roster is not a ladder. Not one of
-- these three is stronger than the others, so a price rising down the column would
-- be the counter saying the last one is the best one, which is the one thing four
-- openings are written *not* to be.
--
-- And a hero bought is not his weapon bought. A run is still handed whatever line
-- its character carries, whatever the book has opened (`issue` in
-- src/loadout.lua) -- but carrying it as somebody *else* waits until five minutes
-- have been survived as the hero it belongs to (src/collection.lua). That is the
-- lesson tool's own bargain: the pencil is a science tool until science has been
-- sat through, and the star is the starman's until the starman has lasted half a
-- lesson holding it. So a purchase opens a hero and the hero opens his weapon,
-- which is what keeps the counter from being three fresh cards sold for coins.
--
-- **A character is one line of the catalogue, issued.** It used to be three
-- numbers -- a reach, a damage multiplier and a beat -- read straight off this
-- row by src/player.lua, which meant the hands-free attack was something a hero
-- *was* rather than something a run *had*. Both attacks are passive weapon lines
-- now (SHOT and SWORD in src/upgrades.lua, flown by src/shot.lua and
-- src/sword.lua), those three numbers are on their blocks, and all that is left
-- here is which line the run is handed on the way in -- taken to level one by
-- Loadout.new, spending a weapon slot exactly as a drafted one would.
--
-- What falls out of that is the point of having done it: any hero can draft any
-- weapon, so the character is where a run *starts* rather than a wall around what
-- it can become. The two that open without a hands-free attack say it loudest --
-- a starman who drafts SHOT has spent a card on the thing a shootman was handed.
--
-- What a character still does not touch is deliberate. Speed, health, the ink
-- meter, the tool the lesson issues and every upgrade line are the same for all
-- four, so a build learned as one is a build that reads as the next.
--
-- **Two files, and two different kinds of fact.** `character.txt` is one line --
-- which hero was last picked -- and it is a setting: read back on the next launch,
-- and a key the game does not recognise, or one this book has not bought, is
-- ignored rather than trusted. `roster.txt` is the register beside it, one line per
-- hero the book has anything to say about: whether it has been paid for, and how
-- long the longest run as it lasted. Both of those are things that only ever go up
-- -- nothing takes a hero away and a best is a maximum, src/records.lua's rule --
-- so, as everywhere else here, a line edited into something unreadable costs that
-- hero what it says and nothing else.

--           the hero board falls back to that file while the new one does not
--           exist, so renaming a character does not take somebody's drawing away
--   name    what the studio's selector calls it
--   blurb   the one line under the arrows saying how it fights. Kept inside 24
--           characters, which is what the studio's column is already as wide as
--           (its longest hint), so a character costs that screen no width. Caps,
--           digits and a full stop only: the 3x5 face has no comma, and a glyph
--           it does not have comes out as a space (src/font.lua)
--   weapon  the id of the weapon line in src/upgrades.lua the run opens holding,
--           at level one. This is the whole of how the heroes fight differently:
--           where you have to stand, how hard it lands and how often are all
--           numbers on that line's block, so they are read once, by the weapon,
--           and a hero who later drafts another line flies it exactly as the hero
--           it came from does
--   price   what the canteen charges for this hero, written as a list of one so
--           that a row of the roster and a row of src/perks.lua answer the same
--           five questions about a price. Absent on the one hero the book comes
--           with, which is also how the counter knows not to put it on the page
--   icon    not written here: filled in below off the weapon line, since a hero's
--           icon on the counter is the icon of the thing he fights with
--   design  what this character *also* has to be drawn, by name in
--           src/design.lua: the hero's board hands straight on to it. Every row
--           has one and it is the same drawing the weapon line names, which is
--           what makes the handoff worth having -- you draw what you fight with
--           on the way in rather than being sent to the board by a card for
--           something you already had

-- What a hero costs, and it is one number for all three of them.
--
-- A run that reaches the eye pays about two dozen coins (src/purse.lua), so this is
-- a couple of good afternoons apiece and all three are most of a week -- dearer
-- than the whole reroll line and about a retake and a half, which is where a hero
-- belongs: the perks are things you spend inside a run and this is the run itself
-- turning up as somebody else.
--
-- One number rather than three because none of the three is better than the others
-- (see the header). If a fourth is ever added that genuinely asks more of you than
-- the rest, it wants a sentence here saying so rather than quietly costing more.
