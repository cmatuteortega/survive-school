-- The drawing board: whatever this game asks you to draw, you draw here.
--
-- It opens twice. Between answering the title screen and the run starting you
-- are handed a stick man, a pencil, a pen and a rubber, and whatever you leave
-- on the board is the sprite you play as. Mid-run, the first time a draft gives
-- you a weapon that is drawn rather than issued, the board comes back with that
-- weapon on it (src/design.lua) -- you are not handed a star, you draw one.
--
-- The board *is* the sprite either way, one cell per pixel, blown up by a whole
-- number the way main.lua blows up the whole canvas -- so there is nothing
-- between what you draw and what walks onto the page a second later. The
-- life-size copy standing in the margin is the same sprite at 1:1, which is the
-- only honest preview of something fifteen pixels across. Nothing in here is
-- written down about what is being drawn: the board is as many cells as the
-- design has pixels, and the title, the hint and the preview are the design's.
--
-- The board is the biggest thing on the screen and everything else is set beside
-- it in a column: the title, the copy, the boxes, the line saying what the
-- screen is waiting for. The tools are pinned to the right edge of the safe area
-- on the run's own margin, in the run's own box, popping out the same way when
-- selected -- the tools are in the same place on the page whether you are
-- drawing the hero or playing him, so there is only one spot to reach for. Where
-- there is no room for a column beside the board -- a phone held upright -- the
-- same pieces go above and below it instead, and the two arrangements are picked
-- between by which leaves the bigger cell to draw on.
--
-- It asks to be finished the way every other screen here asks anything: a box
-- you scribble in (src/scribble.lua). OK! keeps what is on the board and hands
-- it over; RESET puts back what you were given to draw over. Ink that lands
-- outside the board and outside the boxes is not part of the drawing -- it is
-- just ink on the page, and fades off it.
--
-- The hero's board asks one thing more, between the drawing and the boxes: *which*
-- hero this is
-- (src/characters.lua), between two arrows. That is the one thing on this screen
-- that is pressed rather than drawn in -- the timetable's rule, where a tab is
-- pressed and only leaving is answered: which character to look at is not the
-- question, and it can be changed as many times as you like before OK!. It is
-- here rather than on the timetable because it is a question about the drawing --
-- pick the swordsman and OK! hands the screen straight on to the board his sword
-- is drawn on, since a sword he swings is as much of him as his own outline.
