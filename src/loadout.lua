-- What a run has learned.
--
-- One of these is built by Game:reset and thrown away with the run. It holds
-- the level a run has reached on every upgrade line (src/upgrades.lua) and
-- turns that into three things the rest of the game reads:
--
--   stats    every number about the player, from move speed to how far xp comes
--   tools    the run's *own copy* of Tools.list, with the upgrades applied
--   weapons  the passive weapons that fight for you, live
--
-- All three are rebuilt from scratch every time an upgrade is taken, by
-- replaying every level from the ground up. That costs nothing at the rate a
-- run levels up, and it buys two things worth far more than it: no level has to
-- undo anything, and a number that depends on the shape of the window comes out
-- right again when the window changes shape.
--
-- The tools are copies because Tools.list is shared by every run the program
-- plays and upgrades change the numbers in it. The weapons are *not* rebuilt:
-- an orbit that has been turning for two minutes keeps its angle when the
-- upgrade that speeds it up lands, and a rocket already in the air keeps the
-- numbers it was fired with.
--
-- One line can also take another *off* a run: a fusion (`needs` and `fuses` in
-- src/upgrades.lua) is only dealt once every line it is made of is finished, and
-- the lines it names in `fuses` stop reaching the strip and give their places
-- back the moment it lands. That is the only thing in the game that undoes a
-- pick, and it is written so that it does not: the fused lines keep their levels
-- and those levels are still replayed onto their tools, which simply stop being
-- handed out. Nothing here has to remember a fusion happened -- `Loadout:ready`
-- reads `needs` off the catalogue and `rebuild` works `fuses` out from the lines
-- taken -- which is what keeps a run restored from a bookmark, a list of levels
-- and nothing else, arriving in exactly the same state.

-- asking the same question of the weapons, and they are two lines and two stats

-- duration the thing being on the page, or a journey to somewhere and a wait for
-- something -- and each answers it against what its own half of the game is made
-- of.
--
-- Which is why this walks the top-level fields and the drop block and stops
-- there. A brush's `life` is exactly how long it keeps hitting, walling or
-- lingering, and the gluestick's `freeze` is its whole point. A pin's hold and
-- its life are one number written twice (src/tools.lua) and have to stay that
-- way, so both move together. But the line a ruler leaves, the circle a compass
-- leaves and the slit the scissors leave have already done everything they are
-- ever going to do -- the hit landed on the swing, or on the tap -- so
-- stretching those would put nothing on the page but old pencil.
--
-- The compass's `sweep.turn` is left alone for a stronger reason than that, and
-- anyone adding a duration here should know it: the leg cuts what it passes over
-- as it arrives, so a slower turn gives the far side of the circle *longer to
-- walk out*. It is the one length of time in the game where more is worse, and a
-- blanket "things last longer" that reached it would quietly make the compass
-- worse every time the card was taken.
--
-- The highlighter's `ignite.time` is also left alone, and it is the one exclusion
-- here worth reading next to the laminate's list, because that pass *does* stretch
-- the bomb's crater and the two look like the same thing from a distance. They are
-- not. `ignite` is a body burning: something that touched the band is on fire, and
-- how long it burns for is how much damage that one hit ends up doing -- a hit
-- still landing on a thing already hit, which is the sharpener's to sell. A crater
-- is a *place*, and how long it smoulders is how long that stretch of page is
-- somewhere the crowd cannot walk. One is damage with a duration attached; the
-- other is ground, and ground is exactly what this axis is for.

-- not tidiness -- it is what lets a player hold both cards and know what each of

--
-- So the question asked of every duration here is: is this the thing being on the
-- page, or is it a journey to somewhere and a wait for something? A crater
-- smouldering, a sun at full height, a beam lying across the paper, a spiral
-- wound on and a trail behind you are all the first. A rocket's time of flight, a
-- fuse and a wind-up are all the second, and the second is nobody's to sell here.
--
-- It is a list rather than a walk because `life` means three different things
-- across the twelve blocks and only one of them is persistence -- and because the
-- one nested field it wants (`burn.life`) is a field a blind walk would have to go
-- looking for.
--
--   spiral  `life` is how long a spiral stays wound onto the page and `hold` is
--           how long what it caught keeps walking in after the ink has gone. Both
--           are the gluestick's freeze by another name -- this weapon does no
--           damage at all, so a hold is the entire thing there is to lengthen and
--           it is the least arguable entry in either pass.
--   skate   `life` is how long one stamp of the trail stays down, which is the
--           whole footprint of the weapon: the trail is the only thing in the game
--           whose *size* is a length of time, so this is the biggest single thing
--           the laminate does anywhere. It is also the one entry with a frame
--           budget behind it -- the trail is `life x speed / SPACING` stamps long
--           and every walk over it costs that (`SPACING` in src/skate.lua), so the
--           laminate and the paper plane between them roughly treble it. Still a
--           hundred-odd oval stamps, which is one texture draw each and a bounded
--           box test per enemy on a half-second tick.
--   bomb    `burn.life` is the crater going on smouldering, which is ground you
--           took away -- a puddle in the other half of the palette (src/bomb.lua),

--           landing on something already hit. The fuse is *not* here: that is the
--           wait, it is the whole of what the bomb's own line is about, and this
--           must not sell it from the other end.
--   sun     `stay` is the seconds at full height, and only that. `up` and `down`
--           are the rising and the setting -- transitions rather than the sun
--           being up -- and stretching them would slow the animation down instead
--           of leaving the disc there for longer. `gap` is the metronome's.
--   beam    `hold` is how long the light is actually across the page, which is
--           worth nothing at all until the level that turns the flash into a beam
--           and then worth as much as anything here. `charge` is not here for two
--           reasons pointing the same way: it is a wind-up, and its own line
--           refuses to sell it because the wind-up is the half of the weapon you
--           play.
--
-- What is deliberately *not* here, since each one is a duration somebody will
-- reach for:
--
--   rocket  its `life` is time of flight, so stretching it is *range* -- and
--           with the aiming gone (src/rocket.lua) range is most of what an
--           unaimed volley is worth, which makes this the one entry here it
--           would be easiest to talk yourself into. Its own line sells the shape
--           of the volley instead, deliberately, and the burst at the end of a
--           flight is a hit landing rather than anything left on the page.
--   cool S  it has no life at all. What ends one is the viewport running out from
--           under it, and there is no number here to move.
--   storm   nothing it does persists. The shock an enemy wears is an outline with
--           an expiry, which is a readout rather than an effect.
--   spiral  `push` -- the finale's ring round your own feet -- has no life either:
--           it never leaves, and math.huge does not need help.
--   ticks   every one of them, everywhere. A tick is how *often* something already
--           on the page hurts, which is a rate and not a length -- and it is not
--           the metronome's either, for the same reason: what it would buy is
--           damage per second, which is what the graphite is for.
--
-- And one that is worse than not helping, which is the sun's `soak`: the seconds
-- under the disc before a survivor carries the bleach out. Multiplying that up
-- makes the mark *harder* to earn, so it is the compass's `sweep.turn` in the tool
-- pass above -- the second length of time in this game where more is worse, and
-- the second reason both of these passes are lists and not walks.

-- The metronome, and the one multiplier in the game a weapon module never sees.
-- The three fields below are every gap in the catalogue and they all mean the

-- walk by name rather than a list of twelve:
--
--   every   the gap between one shot, swing, launch, drop, cloud or spiral and
--           the next. Nine of the blocks have one, and the sunrays have theirs a
--           level deeper than the block, which is the only nesting here.
--   gap     the sun's, and only the sun's: it is the stretch it spends below the
--           page between one rising and the next, which is `every` written from
--           the other end because the sun is up for a while rather than at once.
--   rehit   the star's and the flock's, which are the two weapons that are simply
--           *there* and have no launch to space out. The gap between one cut of
--           the same enemy and the next is the only cadence either of them has,
--           so it is theirs.
--
-- Everything else about a weapon's clock is left alone, and the two that will be
-- reached for are worth naming. A `tick` -- the sun's burn, the skate's cut, the
-- crater's smoulder -- is how fast something already landed goes on hurting,
-- which is damage per second and belongs to the damage lines; the fixative's own
-- exclusions above are written on the same reasoning. And a wind-up or a fuse is
-- the half of a weapon you *play* -- the beam's `charge` and the bomb's `fuse`
-- are each sold by their own line, on purpose, and this must not sell them
-- again. The beam is the one place that shows: its rest is the period less the
-- wind-up and the light, so shortening the period comes out of the rest alone
-- and a fully-bought pair leaves it at nothing. Beam:rest floors there rather
-- than running backwards, so that is a beam with no gap in it and not a clock in
-- trouble.

--- the draft -----------------------------------------------------------------

-- How many *lines* of each kind one run can carry. A kind missing from here is

-- capping them would be capping the run, which is the one thing they exist not
-- to do. Everything a run's *shape* is made of is still counted here.
--
-- The cap is on how many lines a run may *start*, not on how many levels it may
-- take. That is the whole mechanic: once the slots are full the lines a run has
-- never touched stop being offered, and the ones it has carry on coming up until
-- they are finished. A run stops collecting and starts committing.
--
-- Four tools is still the tightest of the three caps, because a tool line's
-- first level hands you the tool itself: the strip is drafted, not issued. One
-- of the four is gone before the run starts -- the lesson hands one over (`tool`
-- in src/subjects.lua) and it is taken as the run is built -- so what the draft
-- is really offering is the other three. Ten tools you can all reach would be ten
-- tools none of which you had to choose between.
--
-- The weapon cap is five against the ten lines written, and one of the five is
-- gone before the run starts: the character hands one of them over the way the
-- lesson hands over a tool (src/characters.lua), so what the draft is really
-- offering is the other four. It went from four to five when those two attacks
-- became lines of their own for exactly that reason -- a run drafts as many
-- weapons as it always did, and the thing it came with is now counted honestly
-- instead of being invisible. It still bites hardest of the three: a run starts

-- the passes that are the run's fire. Everything a tool did landed earlier in the
