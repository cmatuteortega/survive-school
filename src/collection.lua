-- What of the book has been opened, and what it asks for.
--
-- The catalogue is a hundred and fifty levels down thirty-six lines and the draft
-- lays three cards, so for most of this project the whole of it was reachable on
-- the first run and none of it was ever *arrived at*. The library (src/library.lua)
-- was written to answer half of that -- the catalogue read out loud on a page you
-- are standing still on -- and this is the other half: two thirds of those lines
-- are not in the book yet, and the library is where you find out what there is and
-- what it costs. A catalogue you can read is a list; a catalogue with holes in it
-- is a collection.
--
-- **It is keyed to what the book already remembers and has no file of its own.**
-- That is the whole shape of the feature rather than a saving: src/records.lua
-- keeps one line per lesson and every number on it is a *maximum*, so an unlock
-- read off a record can never be taken away, can never disagree with anything, and
-- costs nothing to keep in step. There is no owned-set to write, no order to
-- replay, and a hand-edited records file is the only way to be wrong about any of
-- it. Nothing here is saved because nothing here is a fact of its own -- every one
-- of them is a fact about a run you already played.
--
-- **One feat, one line.** A quest used to hand over two -- a weapon and a passive
-- together, so that every unlock changed two of the library's shelves at once --
-- and the two were never separable afterwards: a player who wanted the pen was
-- told to survive two minutes and handed a bomb as well, and neither half of that
-- could be moved, priced or retired without moving the other. Seventeen quests
-- with one line apiece say the same thing at the same rate and each of them is a
-- row that can be re-aimed on its own, which is what makes the shelf readable at
-- all: one hole, one price, one thing behind it.
--
-- **The four things a quest may ask for** are the four columns the register can
-- answer, and they are deliberately not one axis with four numbers on it:
--
-- - `time` -- the longest run anywhere in the book. Asks you to last.
-- - `kills` -- the biggest body count on any one page. Asks you to fight, and
--   quietly asks *where*: some pages hand you four kills a second and some ten,
--   so a big number is a page you went and found.
-- - `sat` -- how many lessons have been played far enough in that the boss walked
--   on. Asks you to go round the book rather than to get better at one page of it.
-- - `beat` -- how many lessons have had their boss put down. Asks you to win, and
--   to win in more than one place.
--
-- The ladder alternates between them on purpose. Three time quests in a row would
-- be one quest with three prices, and a run would learn to chase one number and
-- ignore the register's other columns.
--
-- **`played` used to be the third of those and is not a question any more.** It
-- counted lessons opened at all, and it stopped meaning anything the day the
-- timetable itself went behind a ladder: a lesson you have played is a lesson you
-- unlocked by playing the one above it, so PLAY 3 LESSONS was a demand that could
-- not be missed. Being round the book is what the term is for now, and what is
-- asked here instead is how *far into* the pages you got.
--
-- **And only three of the seventeen ask about a boss**, which is a deliberate
-- ceiling rather than a shortage of ideas. The eye is provisional -- one fight
-- standing in for seven, six of which nobody has drawn -- so a ladder leaning on
-- it is a ladder that cannot be tuned until they all exist. `sat` is the half of
-- the same question that does not care what walks on at minute ten, and it carries
-- five quests to `beat`'s three for exactly that reason. When the seven bosses are
-- real the obvious move is to put the *lesson tools* behind beating their own
-- lesson rather than sitting it; today that would be forty-three lines of the
-- eighty-one hanging off six fights that do not exist.
--
-- **What is never held back is what a run is *handed*.** `issue` in src/loadout.lua
-- does not come through here at all, so a lesson still opens holding its tool and a
-- character still opens holding its weapon whatever any of this says. That is the
-- rule everything below is written against, and it is what makes the second half of
-- the ladder possible: a gate on a line somebody is handed is not a lock on having
-- it, it is a lock on **carrying it anywhere else**.
--
-- Which is what the seven lesson tools are. A lesson hands out one tool
-- (`tool` in src/subjects.lua) and no two lessons hand out the same one, so each of
-- them is gated on *its own lesson* being sat all the way through -- ten minutes,
-- `SIT`, which is the boss's own arrival (`Spawner.BOSS_AT`). Until then the pencil
-- is a science tool: you draw with it on that page all you like and the draft will
-- not deal it to you anywhere else, and the library says so rather than pretending
-- the thing does not exist. Sit the lesson out and it is yours everywhere.
--
-- Sat rather than *beaten*, and the two words are kept apart everywhere in this
-- file: **SIT** is being still on the page when the boss walks on and **BEAT** is
-- putting it down. It used to be one word, `PASS`, which meant the first and read
-- as the second.
--
-- Those seven are **derived from the timetable rather than written out**, which is
-- the one thing here to preserve: a lesson gates the tool it issues, so a new
-- lesson gates its own with nothing to keep in step and no way for the two lists to
-- drift apart. It also quietly enforces the rule the README already asks for --
-- two lessons issuing one line is not caught anywhere else, and here it is caught
-- at load, since a line may only be gated once.
--
-- The three tools no lesson issues -- the pen, the gluestick and the scissors --
-- have nowhere to be a local tool of, so they are gated on the ladder like a weapon.
--
-- **And three of the four character weapons are the same bargain again.** The book
-- comes with one hero and the other three are bought at the canteen
-- (src/characters.lua), which is what makes the weapons they carry gateable at all:
-- a lock on a line every run is handed would be a lock on nothing, and a lock on a
-- line only *some* runs are handed is a lock on carrying it as anybody else. So a
-- bought hero's line is his until five minutes have been survived as him, `RIDE`,
-- and then it is in the book for everybody. The base hero's line is the one weapon
-- gated by nothing, and it has to be: it is what a fresh book's first draft has to
-- deal.
--
-- Those three are **derived from the roster** for the reason the seven lesson tools
-- are derived from the timetable: a hero gates the weapon he carries, so a fourth
-- one to buy brings its own gate with it and there is no second list to fall out of
-- step. It catches the same kind of typo on the way in, too -- two heroes carrying
-- one line would be two gates on it, which asserts.
--
-- **And the fusions are behind their own parts.** Forty-five of them, every pair
-- of the ten tools, and until now not one was held back by anything -- so a fresh
-- book's library read fifty-one of eighty-one lines open while the draft could
-- reach six. That was the counter lying rather than the ladder being generous: a
-- fusion has never been dealable without both its tools finished on the strip
-- (`Loadout:ready`), so what was missing was the book *saying* so.
--
-- Derived from `needs` for the reason the lesson tools are derived from the
-- timetable: a new fusion brings its own gate and there is no second list to fall
-- out of step. `needs` and not `fuses`, because a fusion wants a catalyst passive
-- as well as its two tools and a book missing the cartridge is a book that cannot
-- reach the nine fusions built on it. Nothing here recurses -- a fusion is made of
-- tools and passives and never of another fusion -- so `Collection.has` asking
-- `Collection.has` of its parts goes exactly one deep.
--
-- What this does *not* do is change what a run may be dealt, and the one word that
-- keeps it that way is in src/loadout.lua: a fusion is exempt from this file at
-- the draft, because `ready` already asks a strictly stronger question. The one
-- case where the two disagree is the case the exemption is for -- a lesson tool is
-- *handed* to you on its own page long before the book has it, so PENCIL crossed
-- with PEN is buildable on science while the collection still calls the pencil
-- shut. The shelf's answer and the draft's answer are different questions: what
-- could be built at all, and what can be taken now.
--
-- **And the timetable itself is behind this now**, which is the one thing here that
-- is not a line in the catalogue at all. Seven lessons a fresh book could sit in
-- any order was seven doors with the same nothing written on them: the pages are
-- the widest choice in the game and the first run had to make it blind, having
-- never seen a page or held a tool. So a lesson is opened by the lesson *above* it
-- in `Subjects.list` -- the book is a book, and you work down it -- and the bar is
-- a rung higher each time: two minutes on science opens P.E., three minutes on
-- P.E. opens grammar, and so on down to seven on maths for art. A minute a rung
-- rather than one bar for all six because the ladder is also the difficulty curve
-- the game does not otherwise have: the front of the book is a page you are handed
-- and the back of it is a page you are good enough for, and the last rung stops
-- three minutes short of a `SIT` so that opening the deepest page and sitting it
-- out stay two different afternoons.
--
-- It is the same kind of lock as a lesson tool read from the other end. A tool is
-- gated on its own page being sat; a page is gated on the page before it being
-- sat *some of the way*, which is what makes the two of them one ladder rather
-- than two: the run that opens maths is the run that is most of the way to owning
-- the pushpin everywhere.
--
-- **Where a run finds out.** `Loadout:candidates` is the one place this is asked
-- during a run, beside the ban EXPEL leaves and for the same reason: what the draft
-- may reach is one list and one question, not a filter every deal has to remember.
-- A line already under way is offered whatever this says, exactly as it is offered
-- whatever the slots say -- nothing a run is carrying is ever taken off it.
--
-- **And there is a switch in front of both doors while the game is being made.**
-- src/dev.lua overrides the two answers below -- and nothing else, and nothing on
-- disk -- so a book that has opened everything, or nothing, can be stood in front
-- of without a record being written or a register being edited back afterwards.
-- It comes out at launch, and it costs so little to take out for the reason this
-- header keeps giving: there are two doors, and everything asks through them.
--
-- One of the two other doors this was built for is now open, and it went in exactly
-- where the header said it would: the canteen sells a hero and the hero's weapon is
-- a `need` of its own answered in `Collection.met`, with nothing above that line
-- changed. The other -- a homework page that awards one -- goes in the same way.
