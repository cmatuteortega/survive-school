-- The retake card: the death card with no answer at all -- the only card in the
-- game that asks nothing, because a card offering to spend a life you already
-- bought is a question with one sensible answer. It runs on a clock instead
-- (`HOLD`), and nothing reaches it: no pen, no marks, no keys, hence the only
-- card here with no `Scribble.newPen` and no `Scribble.newMarks`.
--
-- The grace `Player:revive` hands over does not start running until the card
-- lifts (the player is only stepped while the state is `playing`), so the beat
-- spent reading this is not a beat spent spending it. The title is ink and
-- still like GAME OVER's, never the win card's blue: this is not a win. The
-- colour is spent on the count, which is the only news on the page.
