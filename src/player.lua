-- How hard the page is knocked when something lands on you (`Camera.knock`).
--
-- This is the one thing in the game that scales with what a hit was worth, and
-- it is the mirror image of the enemies' flinch, which deliberately does not
-- (`HIT_*` in src/enemy.lua). A monster that took a hit has a number thrown off
-- it saying how hard, so its flinch only has to say *that* it happened; you get
-- no number. What you get is a bar that has already moved, in the corner, which
-- is the last place you are looking while something is chasing you -- so the
-- knock is the only thing in the frame that says how much of it just went, and
-- it says it where you cannot miss it.
--
-- Measured as a share of the bar rather than in points, because that is the
-- thing the player actually cares about: a skull's 12 is most of a knock on a
-- fresh page and rather less of one thirty levels later, which is what being
-- tougher ought to feel like. `SHAKE_FULL` is the share that buys the whole
-- thing -- 15%, so an ordinary skull hit at base health lands near the top of
-- the range and everything smaller is spread across the rest of it, rather than
-- every hit in the game bunching up at the quiet end.
local SHAKE_SOFT = 2    -- pixels, what the lightest tap is worth

local SHAKE_FULL = 0.15 -- the share of the bar that pays for SHAKE_HARD

-- What getting back up is worth, for the one thing in the game that lets you
-- (RETAKE, src/perks.lua, through `Game:openRetake`). Both numbers live here
-- rather than on the perk's own row for the reason the language lives on I18n:
-- health and the window nothing can touch you in are the two numbers this file
-- owns, and the catalogue over there is a name and a list of prices.
--
-- Half a page rather than all of it, because a full bar would make the perk a
-- fourth life bought with coins rather than a second chance -- what you are handed
-- back is enough to get out of the crowd that killed you and not enough to stand
-- in it. The grace is more than three times an ordinary hit's window
-- (`INVULN_TIME`) and that is the whole of what makes it a chance at all: you come
-- back standing exactly where you died, which is by definition the worst place on
-- the page, and a hero who came back on the same 0.6s everything else gets would
-- be killed again by the same blob before he had taken a step.

-- The hands-free attack is not here at all any more, and neither is the clock it
-- came on. It was two constants and a dozen lines in this file -- a shot at
-- whatever was nearest, or a swing if the character was the kind who swings --
-- and it is now two passive weapons like any other (src/shot.lua, src/sword.lua)
-- with their numbers on their own blocks in src/upgrades.lua. What that changed
-- is what a hero *is*: he walks, he draws, he takes hits and he levels up, and
-- everything that fights on his behalf is a line the run is carrying. A character
-- is which of those two lines he opens the run holding (src/characters.lua) and
-- nothing else, so a swordsman can end a run shooting.

-- The experience ladder, and it is a curve rather than a ratio on purpose.
--
-- It used to be exponential -- every level 1.35x the cost of the one before --
-- which sounds gentle and is not. By level 30 a single level wanted 40,000 xp,
-- which is six minutes of a horde at full tilt for one card, and a run simply
-- stopped levelling somewhere around 28. That put the real ceiling on a run
-- nowhere near where the draft's is: the four-slot caps (`Loadout.SLOTS`) leave
-- room for 59 picks, so over half of what a run was *allowed* to learn was never
-- once put on a card. The ladder was the wall, not the catalogue.
--
-- Quadratic keeps the shape and loses the wall. A level still costs more than
-- the one before it and always by more than it did last time, so the late ones
-- are still earned -- what it no longer does is outrun the page. The two curves
-- sit within a few percent of each other up to about level 10, which is the
-- stretch anyone has ever actually felt, and they part company after it.
--
-- 0.9 is set against what the horde pays out rather than picked for its shape.
-- The spawner's floor and batch size (src/spawner.lua) have a run earning
-- somewhere between 85 and 140 xp a second once every enemy is unlocked, which
-- lands the 59th and last pick between minute 15 and minute 20 depending on how
-- fast the build clears. Past there the ladder carries on and so does the
