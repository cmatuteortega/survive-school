-- The book the back pages are read in: two leaves, a crease down the middle,
-- and a page you turn with your finger.
--
-- The library, the canteen and the homework page were each one page with `< >`
-- under it, and stepping them was a cut: the section was one thing on one frame
-- and another thing on the next. That is the right furniture for a list and the
-- wrong furniture for a *book*, which is what all three of them are -- they are
-- read off the back of the same notebook the run is played on, they are stepped
-- in a fixed order, and the one gesture a phone has for "the next of these" is
-- the one your hand already makes over a page.
--
-- So a section is a spread rather than a page. Two leaves side by side with the
-- gutter between them, the section laid across both (the library's shelf on the
-- verso and the entry it opens on the recto; the canteen's and the homework
-- page's rows split down the middle), and a drag lifts the recto off the crease,
-- bends it, carries it across and lays it down as the next section's verso.
-- Which is what a leaf of a book *is*: one sheet with the end of one spread
-- printed on the front of it and the start of the next on the back.
--
-- **The whole of it is three numbers.** A leaf is a sheet hinged at the crease.
-- The sheet as a whole is standing at `mid`, it bows by `phi` radians over its
-- length, so it runs from `psi = mid - phi/2` at the root to `mid + phi/2` at the
-- free edge, and a point `u` along the paper is lying at `theta = psi + phi*u`.
-- Everything else falls out of integrating that:
--
--     x(u) = W * (sin(theta) - sin(psi)) / phi
--
-- -- where that bit of paper has got to across the page -- and `cos(theta)`,
-- which is how square-on it is to you, and so both which face of the sheet you
-- are looking at (the front while it is positive, the back once it is not) and
-- how much light it is catching.
--
-- The bow is hung either side of `mid` rather than off the root, and `mid` is
-- taken as `acos(1 - 2p)` rather than as `p * pi`, and both of those are there for
-- the same reason: **the free edge has to go where the finger goes.** A sheet bent
-- away from a root at the drag angle projects far wider than the drag asked for,
-- so the page hangs back and then whips across at the end; taken through the
-- arc-cosine and bowed symmetrically, the free edge travels within a percent or
-- two of straight across the page, which is what a hand dragging it expects. The
-- bend is then a thing that happens to the paper *between* the finger and the
-- spine, which is exactly what it is.
--
-- That is the whole model, and it is deliberately the whole model: no
-- perspective, no vertical foreshortening, nothing sampled off a curve at an
-- angle. A page is blitted a *column* at a time, every column a whole pixel wide
-- at a whole pixel position, which is the one way to bend a page that does not
-- break the rule the rest of this game is drawn under (see the head of
-- DESIGNDOC.md): whole pixels only, never at an angle. The bend is in which
-- source column lands where, and in nothing else.
--
-- **Shading steps down the palette rather than fading.** A column lying at an
-- angle catches less light, and the game has exactly one way to say that in
-- eight colours with no alpha: move the colour one rung darker, which is the
-- move `Palette.overprint` already makes for ink landing on a ruled line. So the
-- ramp here is that column of that table walked twice, and the sheet is drawn
-- through a shader that walks each pixel down it -- nothing where the paper is
-- square on, two rungs where it is edge-on, and everything between.
--
-- "Everything between" is where the second half of the rule comes in, because
-- there is no colour between paper and graphite and there never will be. A
-- fraction of a rung is *dithered*: a 4x4 comb decides, per pixel, whether it
-- takes the rung above or the one below, so three-tenths of a rung is three
-- pixels in ten one step darker. Which is how every fade in this game is drawn
-- (src/scribble.lua) and the only way this one could be -- quantised to three
-- flat bands, a bending page came out as three grey slabs with straight edges,
-- and straight edges are the one thing a curve must not have.
--
-- One entry of that table is not reused, and it is the interesting one. Paper
-- over anything is paper, because paper is an eraser and an eraser does not
-- stack; but paper *in shade* is graphite, because shade is not something laid on
-- the page, it is less light reaching it. Two different questions that happen to
-- share a ramp for the other seven colours -- and with paper left as an eraser
-- the shadow of a lifted leaf came out as a row of dashes, the ruling darkening
-- under it and the page between the rules not.
--
-- **A leaf that has no room is not a leaf.** A phone held upright gives the page
-- about 180 pixels across and half of that is not a page of anything, so under
-- MIN_LEAF the book collapses to one leaf: no crease, the screen lays its two
-- halves out stacked as it always did, and the same drag lifts the *whole* page
-- away about its left edge to show the next one underneath. Half a turn rather
-- than a whole one, because with one leaf showing there is no back of the sheet
-- to land on -- what is under it is already where you are going.
--
-- **The drag and the pen share the page.** Everything here is drawn on, so every
-- press has to be read as either a line or a turn, and the reading has to be over
-- in the first few pixels or the page stops answering the pen.
--
-- A press within GRAB of the outer edge of a leaf is a turn on the frame it lands,
-- no threshold at all: that is where a hand reaches for a page, and it is the one
-- strip of these screens with nothing printed on it. A press anywhere else is
-- **undecided**, and stays undecided for at most SLIP pixels of travel or HOLD
-- seconds, whichever comes first -- sideways and it is a turn, anything else and
-- it is a line, and a finger that has sat still for a tenth of a second is a line
-- too. While it is undecided the pen lays nothing, and that is the whole of what
-- the gesture costs: the first five pixels of a stroke, on three screens whose own
-- headers say the ink on them is ink and fades.
--
-- The bias is deliberate and it is towards the *line*. A page turn is a fast
-- gesture and a drawn line usually is not, so the two thresholds sort them almost
-- by themselves; and where they do not, a slow drag across the page draws on it
-- and there are two arrows and two page edges that will still turn it.

--- the crease ----------------------------------------------------------------

-- The gutter, drawn by the screen inside its own ink pass so that it prints

-- darkens the paper and the two go under it together. That is the difference
-- between a fold in the page and a grey stripe drawn on one.
--
-- It is dithered rather than banded because it has to *fall off*, and a fall-off
-- in eight colours with no alpha is a thinning of stamps -- the rule every fade
-- in this game is drawn under. The two columns hard against the fold go down
-- solid, since that is the bit of paper standing up out of the binding; from
-- there it thins to nothing by the lip of the gutter.
--
-- The pattern is an ordered one rather than a random drop, and that is not a
-- performance choice. A noise field would be a different field every time the
-- window changed shape, and -- worse -- the eye reads scattered graphite on this
-- page as *pencil*, because scattered graphite on this page is what pencil is
-- (src/scribble.lua). A 4x4 grid reads as tone.
