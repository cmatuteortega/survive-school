-- The bomb sitting on the page, counting down.
--
-- The sixth passive weapon, and the first one that asks the player to wait. The
-- other five all resolve the instant they act -- a star cuts what it turns
-- through, a rocket leaves, a beam is a flash, an S crosses -- so every one of
-- them is a thing that happens *to* the crowd. A bomb is put down and then does
-- nothing at all for a couple of seconds, which turns the page around it into a
-- place: the crowd walks into it while you walk out, and where you were standing
-- a moment ago is suddenly the most interesting square on the paper.
--
-- That is what makes it the one weapon whose whole shape is the *fuse*. It
-- drops at your feet, so you always know exactly where one is; the levels make
-- the crater wider, the drops closer together and the fuse shorter, and the last
-- one leaves the crater burning after the bang. None of them makes it aimed,
-- because the aim is your feet a second ago, which is the same bargain the cool S
-- makes from the other end -- an S is a line through where you *were*, and a bomb
-- is a hole in it.
--
-- It is drawn by the player (src/design.lua) and it is the only drawing in the
-- game shown in a colour nobody drew it in: over the last stretch of the fuse
-- the sprite's own silhouette flashes blue (`drawMask`, the trick the sun's
-- bleach and the S's rim are built out of), accelerating as it goes. The blink is
-- the whole of what the weapon tells you, so it is read off the drawing rather
-- than added next to it -- there is nothing on the page saying "bomb" but the
-- thing you drew, and nothing saying "now" but the blue.
--
-- Blue and not red, and the whole weapon follows it: the flash, the blast and the
-- burn it leaves are one family in the player's own half of the palette -- the
-- half the pen, the bullets and the beam are all drawn in.
-- Red is the other side, so a bomb flashing red read as something the horde had
-- put on the page rather than the one thing on it that was yours. What that costs
-- is the easy contrast: blue is the colour of half the marks on the page, so what
-- makes the flash read is the *silhouette* going solid at a stroke rather than
-- the hue -- which is the other half of why the board asks for a shape worth
-- seeing filled in.
--
-- Nothing here hurts the player, and the colour is now the whole of why that has
-- to stay true: blue is yours and red is theirs, and a bomb that could kill you
-- would be a weapon you had to aim away from your own feet -- which is the one
-- place this one is allowed to go.
