-- starts clear of the pause button, so the health end is a corner button and a

-- puts the health figure under the clock on a portrait page and nowhere near it
-- on a landscape one.
--
-- The floor is what the bar is still a *bar* at. Below about two dozen pixels a

-- Every icon this game puts on a page goes down through here, and there is one
-- reason for that: a fused tool (`Upgrades.fused`) is drawn on a plate of blush
-- and everything else is drawn on nothing, so *where* that happens is a fact
-- about the game rather than a list of screens that remembered. The selector
-- column, the shelf in the library and the entry under it all draw the same
-- fusion the same way without any of them knowing what a fusion is.
--
-- Blush was already the fusion's colour before it was a plate: it is the fill of
-- the one card in the draft that offers one (src/levelup.lua), which is where a
-- player meets the idea. This is that card's colour following the tool out of the
-- draft and onto everything it turns up on afterwards -- and inside the selector
-- box it lands exactly, since the box is thirteen with a one-pixel border and
-- every icon in this game is eleven across.
--
-- The plate is measured off the drawing rather than off an eleven written down
-- here, the way the shadow under a hero is (`Sprites.shadow`), and it is floored
-- to the same pixel the drawing is: half a pixel out either way is a plate with
-- ink hanging off one edge of it.
--
-- `mask` is a colour to draw the silhouette in instead of the drawing -- a spent
-- button, a line the book has not opened -- and it takes no plate by default: a
-- thing drawn as the hole it is has nothing to be special about yet. `plate`
-- overrides both ways round for the one screen that has something else to say
-- with the colour: the library's pair of picks (src/library.lua), where blush on
-- a tool means it is going *into* a fusion rather than being one.

--- what the run is carrying ---------------------------------------------------

-- Only ever drawn while the run is held -- the pause screen and the draft --
-- and never during play. Mid-run the page is the thing you are reading, and
-- every pixel of margin spent on a summary of what you have is a pixel of it
-- you cannot see; the moment the run stops is exactly the moment you want to
-- know. Both screens draw it, so it lives here with the rest of the furniture
-- rather than twice over in two screens that only happen to agree.
--
-- The weapons go down the left margin in the same boxes, at the same size and
-- struck off the same midline as the tools down the right, because the two
-- columns are the two halves of what a run is made of: what you draw with, and
-- what draws for you. Everything else it has learned is not a thing it carries
-- so much as a thing it *is*, so it goes in one line under the question rather
-- than in a column of its own.
--
-- All three sets of icons are drawn in the same box, because a page this busy
-- can't be read against: a bare icon over a horde is a shape with a horde
-- behind it, and the box's paper fill is what makes it a thing on the page
-- instead. Only the levels are placed differently. A weapon's sits beside its
-- box, so the column stays exactly as tall as the tool column it mirrors; a
-- passive's sits on top of its own, where a line of them has all the height it
-- wants and no alignment to keep.
-- CARRY_LEVEL_GAP lives up with the selector constants: both columns use it.
local CARRY_NUM_GAP = 1    -- a passive's level to the box under it
local CARRY_GAP = 5        -- one passive to the next along the line

-- Everything of one kind the run has taken, in the order it was first picked up,
-- which is the only order any of this has.
--
-- One kind at a time rather than weapons-and-everything-else, because there are
-- three places a line can be shown and each takes exactly one kind: weapons down
-- the left, passives in the row under the question, and tools in the selector
-- column down the right, which draws itself. A tool shown in the passive row as
-- well would be the same tool twice on one screen -- and eight icons on a line
-- sized for five would run off the edge of a page held upright.

    -- one thing about the meter you have to catch without reading it. The floor
    -- is an absolute amount of ink rather than a fraction of the well, so an
    -- inkwell run goes blush further down the bar -- what it takes to start a
    -- line does not change because you can carry more.
    --
    -- The bar is how full the well is and the number beside it is how much is
    -- actually in it, which is why the number can read past 100. That is the
    -- health bar's arrangement exactly, and the two are drawn as mirror images
    -- of each other: a fresh page grows the health bar's maximum the same way an
    -- inkwell grows this one's, and both are read at a glance off the length.
    --
    -- Slate rather than blue, though the pen it pays for is blue: blue on this
    -- page means *the player's side of the fight*, and it is spent on the marks
    -- themselves everywhere you look -- the nib, the shots, the beam. A meter in
    -- the same blue is the readout claiming to be one of them. Grey is what the
    -- readout is: furniture, read for its length and not for its colour, which
    -- also leaves the blush at the bottom of it the only colour the meter ever
    -- takes and so the only thing about it that can shout.

    -- It used to be a short bar in the bottom-left corner on desktop and tucked
    -- under the health bar on a phone -- two layouts for one readout, and neither
    -- of them anywhere you are looking. The bottom edge is the one strip of the
    -- page nothing else wants (the corners belong to the thumb stick and to
    -- nobody), and a bar that spans it is read without being looked at: the
    -- whole width of the screen is one level, and how far along it you are is
    -- the only thing you ever needed off this readout. So it is the same bar in
    -- the same place on both, and there is no branch left to get wrong.
    --
    -- The one thing on the page measured off the canvas rather than off the safe
    -- area, and it is the exception that proves the rule. The safe area is there
    -- so that nothing you have to *read* ends up under a notch, and a bar has
    -- nothing in it to read: it is a length, and a length that stops short of the
    -- corners is a length with two gaps at the ends that mean nothing. Run edge
    -- to edge it is the screen itself filling up. What is read off it -- the
    -- level -- is lettering in the middle of the page, which is the furthest
    -- point on this edge from either inset. It still stands *on* the bottom
    -- inset rather than under it, so a gesture bar cuts across nothing.
    --
    -- The level took the kill count's spot, and the swap is the point: kills is
    -- a number you read afterwards on the game over card, where it is half the
    -- score and is read next to the clock. The level is the one you are playing
    -- towards while the run is going, and the bar behind it is how close.
