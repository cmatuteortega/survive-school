--
-- Every question here is a *box you scribble in* -- the title screen asks
-- whether to start, the pause card whether to quit, and the draft you get for
-- levelling up (src/levelup.lua) puts one under each of its three cards. What
-- counts is ground covered inside the box, on a 2px grid, so a line drawn
-- through it answers while a graze does not.
--
-- The answer is only *armed*, not committed, until the pen comes off the page
-- -- so a line that carries on into the next one changes the answer rather
-- than being too late -- and the lettering and the borders are drawn by hand,
-- which here means redrawn a few times a second so they never quite sit still.
-- Nothing in here knows what any answer means: it reports which one is armed
-- and leaves the rest to the screen that asked.
