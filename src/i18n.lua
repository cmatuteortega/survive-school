-- The game in six languages: English, and the five this file maps it to.
--
-- **The English string is the key.** There is no table of symbolic ids anywhere:
-- a line of copy stays written out, in English, in the module it belongs to --
-- the upgrade's own row in src/upgrades.lua, the tool's name in src/tools.lua,
-- the prompt at the top of the screen that says it -- and this file maps that
-- English to Spanish. Every place the game *draws* a string puts it through
-- `I18n.t` on the way to the page.
--
-- That is a deliberate choice and it buys three things worth having. The
-- catalogue keeps its shape: adding an upgrade is still one row in
-- `Upgrades.list` and nothing else, which is the rule the whole extending
-- section of CLAUDE.md is written along, and it would not survive a scheme where
-- a new line meant editing an id table twice as well. A string with no
-- translation falls through to the English rather than to a key, so an
-- un-translated line reads as English copy instead of as `hud.kills.2`. And the
-- source stays readable -- the levels of the pencil line say what they do where
-- they are written, which is most of what makes that file possible to balance.
--
-- What it costs is that two things meaning different things must not be written
-- the same way in English, since they would share a translation. Nothing in the
-- game does today; if it ever does, the fix is to reword one of them, which is
-- usually an improvement anyway.
--
-- **Translation happens at the draw, never at load.** Nothing here is baked into
-- a data table when the module is required, because the language can be changed
-- on the settings page in the middle of a session and the catalogue is the same
-- table for every run the program plays. So `Upgrades.list` holds English for
-- ever and src/levelup.lua, src/library.lua and the rest ask for the Spanish
-- each time they draw it.
--
-- Two things about how the Spanish is *set*, both forced by the 3x5 face
-- (src/font.lua):
--
-- **No acute accents.** A capital in that face fills all five rows and there is
-- nowhere above one to put a mark, so it is ORBITA and MUSICA. Leaving the
-- accent off a capital is ordinary in display lettering; drawing a mark into the
-- letter would not be.
--
-- **N-tilde, and the inverted marks, are drawn.** N-tilde is a letter of the
-- alphabet rather than an accented N -- a word with N in its place is misspelt --
-- and the inverted question and exclamation marks open a sentence in Spanish, so
-- all three are glyphs in the face. They are two bytes each in UTF-8, which is
-- why src/font.lua counts letters rather than bytes.
--
-- **No commas.** The face had no comma glyph when the Spanish was written, so
-- it was written without them -- the same rule a character blurb is already held
-- to. The face has one now, and the later languages use it.
--
-- The four languages in src/lang/ are set by the same rule the first two points
-- make, which is one rule: **a mark that spells is drawn, a mark that only
-- accents is left off the capital.** So the umlauts, the Portuguese tildes and
-- the cedilla are glyphs like N-tilde, and every acute, grave and circumflex is
-- dropped like the Spanish ones are. src/font.lua has the long form.
--
-- **What is deliberately not translated.** Two things, and they are the same
-- thing: a name is not a sentence.
--
-- The **title** on the front of the book is the game's name. SURVIVE SCHOOL
-- reads as SURVIVE SCHOOL in Spanish the way any title does -- it is what the
-- thing is called, not a line of copy about it -- so both of its words stay out
-- of the table below and the title screen draws its own constants. Which is also
-- what keeps that screen's opening honest: the intro writes the title on one
-- letter at a time over a clock struck off its length, and a title that changed
-- length would be an opening that ran at two speeds.
--
-- The **languages' own names** are the other, for the reason given at
-- `I18n.langs`: someone looking for Spanish is looking for the word ESPANOL.
--
-- Which language is picked is saved with the volumes in src/options.lua.

local I18n = {}

-- A language's own name for itself, since that is the one thing on a language
-- selector that should not be translated: someone looking for Spanish is looking
-- for the word ESPANOL, not for the word SPANISH. Set by the face's rules like
-- every other word -- FRANÇAIS keeps its cedilla and PORTUGUES loses its
-- circumflex (src/font.lua).
--
-- The order is the order the settings row steps through them, English first
-- because English is the key and then alphabetical by that name, which is the
-- one order nobody has to be told.
--
-- English is the only one with no dictionary: it is the key. Spanish is the
-- table below, written first and argued for line by line. The rest live in
-- src/lang/, one file each, keyed the same way and set by the same rules; what is
-- particular to each language is said at the top of its own file.

-- lesson's name is a word and a number is not.
