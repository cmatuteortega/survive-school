-- the way out and a record is a maximum, so carrying on and going further banks
-- the further number over the top of it.

-- dead page restarts on a tap: you have just answered a box asking to carry on,
-- and landing on a card asking whether to quit would be the game asking the
-- opposite question. The run-up is the title screen pulling the page away, the

--    arm.
-- 2. Then **reset**, which is what makes this a run at all -- the spawner, the
--    grid, the walls, the empty page, and `resumable` going true again.
-- 3. Then the **levels**, replayed from scratch (`Loadout:restore`), and
--    `applyStats` so the player catches up with the health they buy.
-- 4. Then the **numbers the run had reached**, health and ink and ladder last of
--    all, since they are clamped against what step 3 worked out.

--
-- **This is Game:holdRun and not Game:openDeath, and the difference is everything
-- either of them does.** Dying takes the stick and leaves the run where it lies
-- because there is nothing to give back; this is the pause card's freeze with a
-- different card on it, because every bit of it is about to be given back -- so the
-- open stroke is closed, the paid-for aims are landed and the anchor is dropped,
-- exactly as they are for a level landing. A stroke left open across this would
-- come back down wherever the pointer had wandered to, and the whole point of a
-- retake is that the page you get back is the page you left.
--
-- The burst is **blue**, which is the one place this differs from being killed. Red
-- is the other side of the fight and a red burst is what dying looks like; getting

-- is opened, so what the card prints is what is left rather than what was left.

-- a second, and the honest reading of standing in a hole with the horde is that
-- there is nowhere left to send it.

-- fight the corners of the screen are often outside it, so what has to be tested

-- The other thing that can happen to a body standing on a piece of paper that is
-- no longer there, and the only event in the game that is neither a death nor
-- damage: it is picked up with the paper and put down again in the corner of the
-- page that is still there (`Game:clearCorner`, and the caller asked for that
-- corner once for the whole sweep).
--
-- **It is a reposition and not a despawn, and that is the whole balance of the
-- scissors' last level.** Nothing is credited and nothing is taken: no gem, no xp,
-- no kill on the tally, nothing split and nothing burst -- not as a price, but
-- because nothing died here and nothing was even hurt. The body arrives with the
-- health it walked in with, still walking at you, and the only thing that has
-- changed about it is where it is standing.
--
-- It used to be a despawn, and the trouble with that was never the ledger. A cut
-- that emptied half a page paid for itself in the xp of everything it emptied,
-- which is a real price and reads perfectly well written down -- and in the hand it
-- was a get out of jail free card anyway, because whatever the tally said, the page
-- was clear and the fight was over. So the cut buys the same second of empty paper
-- and never the way out of the fight: the same bodies, the same health, walking
-- back at you from the far corner. It is crowd control with the longest reach in
-- the game, and it is no longer an eraser.
--
-- One thing falls out of that which is worth knowing before anybody tunes a
-- number here: **the spawner is no longer answered by a cut.** A despawned offcut
-- put the horde under the floor, so the run was refilled from the offscreen ring
-- while the page was still open (`FLOOR_RATE`, `REFILL` in src/spawner.lua) --
-- which quietly meant a cut *replaced* the crowd it took. Nothing leaves the horde
-- now, so the floor has nothing to top up and what walks back at you is the same
-- crowd rather than a fresh one. Fewer moving parts, and the tool means one thing.
--
-- And the region goes on answering for arrivals for as long as it is on the page --
-- every caller stays a clock -- which makes the missing paper a *wall*: walk the
-- crowd into it and the crowd comes out in the corner. That is a better reading of
-- a piece of page that is not there than a hole things fell out of the run
-- through, and it is the one the drawing was always making.
--
-- The boss is never lifted, for the reason it is never despawned at range
-- (Game:updateEnemies): it is the one thing on the page that cannot be walked away
-- from, and half a page of distance handed back every half second is a fight you
-- would never have to have. Refused here rather than at any of the four callers,
-- so this is the one door and there is one place that has to know.
--
-- Nothing here asks about pen lines, and it does not have to: a body put down
-- inside one is pushed out of it by `Enemy:resolveWalls` on the next frame, which
-- is the same last word ink already gets over a shove and over a wad's dash.
--
-- Returns whether the body actually moved, which the boss makes worth asking:
-- one caller has something to do to what it has just put down (`sever.paste`, the
-- COLLAGE in src/tools.lua) and doing it to the one thing this door refused would
-- be gluing the eye to the page it is standing on.

-- drew anything), and there are two of them because either alone is wrong. Travel
-- alone calls a slow deliberate short line a tap. Time alone calls a flick a tap,

--
-- **What answers the question the CUTOUT left open.** The pencil could cut what it

-- The first tap of a cut. Nothing is charged here and nothing is on the page but

--
-- Which makes this the one gesture on the strip that is paid for afterwards. The

-- always lands it -- there is no picking one up and changing your mind -- and
-- there is nothing here to land yet. It is also the one press that leaves state
-- behind it for the next press to find, which is why every route that takes the
-- pointer away has to call Game:dropCut.
--
-- **Unless the blades are carrying wire (`cut.wire`, the HINGE in src/tools.lua),
-- and then the anchor is a press that lands something and is charged like one.**
-- A staple goes into the page where you tapped, so half the price goes with it --
-- the row writes the half and the meter is checked against the same number on
-- both taps (Game:updateDrawing), which is what makes the gesture two equal
-- presses of a stapler with a cut thrown in for the second one.
--
-- That is not a special case so much as the free anchor's premise expiring. The
-- anchor is free *because* it does nothing, and the moment it does something the
-- old rule pays out an unlimited stapler: tap to anchor, tap back on the anchor
-- to put the scissors away (see Game:closeCut), and repeat for a staple a tap
-- with nothing spent. Charging the tap that drives the staple closes that and
-- makes the cancel honest at the same time -- you paid for a press and you got a
-- press, which is a better answer than the parent's "nothing for nothing".
--
-- **The block and its price are handed in rather than read off the tool**, and
-- that is what lets a row whose gesture is *not* a cut still make one. A brush
-- carries the scissors as `chord` -- a whole `cut` block that is not the row's
-- block, the `fasten` trick one shape over -- and the SHEAR's chord is tapped for
-- exactly like the parent's (`Game:chordCut`). Neither of these two functions has

    -- second tap yet. Nothing is dotted out of that cross -- the line is printed
    -- when the second tap lands, and what prints it is the cut coming down it.
