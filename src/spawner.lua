-- Drops enemies on a ring just outside the camera so they always walk on from
-- offscreen, and slowly turns up the pressure as the run goes on.
--
-- A run is a **cycle** repeated: ten minutes of horde, then the eye boss, and
-- the horde stops arriving while it is on the page. Killing it wins the run
-- (src/win.lua); carrying on hands the spawner another cycle, harder than the
-- last. The spawner owns that clock because it already owns every other one --
-- what phase the run is in is a fact about what is being spawned.
--
-- At a course that asks for two bosses (`bosses` in src/course.lua) a lesson is
-- two cycles rather than one: the lesson's boss at the end of the first, its
-- encore at the end of the second (`Spawner:lineup`), and only the encore going
-- down opens the win card. Two cycles rather than one long one with two bosses
-- in it, because a cycle is already exactly "ten minutes of horde and a boss" --
-- the health curve, the damage step, the drills widening and the bookmark all
-- count in cycles, and every one of them is right about the encore without
-- being told it exists.

local MAX_ENEMIES = 260

-- ...of which the last few belong to the drills and nothing else.
--
-- This exists because of a thing that is easy to miss about the taps below: past
-- about minute five they are not being held down by the floor or by the wave
-- timer, they are being held down by MAX_ENEMIES. The page sits at its ceiling.
-- Which means a drill scheduled for minute eight -- the half of the run drills
-- were added for -- would find no room and walk on as four monsters, and the
-- game would quietly stop having the feature exactly where it needed it.
--
-- So the ordinary horde stops short and a drill may spend the difference. The
-- trade is real and it is the right way round: the page holds forty fewer bodies
-- of undifferentiated horde in exchange for the shapes always arriving intact,
-- and forty out of 260 is not a difference anybody can see while a wall crossing
-- the page is.
--
-- It is forty *in the first cycle* and it grows with the drills, because a fixed
-- reserve breaks quietly and late: a ring is twenty bodies and drills widen 30% a
-- cycle, so by the fifth cycle one asks for forty-four and would never once fit.
-- Rings would simply stop happening, in the runs that had earned them. Growing
-- the reserve at the same rate means the mix shifts towards shaped arrivals as
-- the cycles go on -- which is the right way for it to shift, since by cycle five
-- health is up twentyfold and undifferentiated bodies are the half of the page
-- with the least left to say. Never past half the ceiling, all the same: the
-- horde is still the game.
local DRILL_ROOM = 40

-- The horde has a floor as well as a ceiling. The floor rises with the
-- difficulty clock at FLOOR_RATE enemies per scaled second, and whenever the
-- horde is under it the spawner refills immediately instead of waiting for the
-- next wave -- so a build that clears the screen is answered with more horde,
-- not a quiet spell, and kill speed buys xp rather than calm. Topped up REFILL
-- at a time, every frame, so a cleared page pours back in over a second or so

Spawner.BOSS_AT = 600

-- What the boss fight spawns alongside the boss.
--
-- It was eyes only, on the grounds that what arrives with the boss should read
-- as the boss's own. That was true and it was also boring: an escort of nothing
-- but shooters is an escort you deal with the same way every time, and once the
-- arena went in (src/arena.lua) it stopped being enough of a problem -- the box
-- means you are already being made to move, and a handful of slow shooters
-- standing in it is a fight you can solve by standing somewhere else.
--
-- A mix instead, and the weights are the argument. Bats are the most of it
-- because they are the one enemy the arena makes genuinely dangerous: they are
-- quick, so on an open page they are a thing you outrun and in a box they are a
-- thing you have to kill. Skulls come next as the weight that has to be spent
-- damage on rather than walked away from, so the escort cannot be ignored while
-- you empty a magazine into something big. Eyes stay, fewest of the plain three,
-- because the fan is still what punishes standing still and the boss is still an
-- eye -- they are the family resemblance rather than the pressure.
--
-- Wads and bulbs are the two the box changes the most, which is why they are in
-- it at all. A wad's dash is dodgeable on an open page by walking off the line
-- it drew; inside a box the line has a wall at the end of it and the room to
-- dodge into is room the boss is also using. A bulb is worse: its burst is
-- ground taken away, and the whole point of the arena is that there is only so
-- much ground. Both are kept low -- two apiece -- because either of them at
-- bat weights would be a fight about the escort rather than about the eye.
--
-- Faster and more of them than the eyes-only version, since the mix is cheaper
-- per body: a bat is two health.

-- What time adds to the horde. Both are compounding, and both are read as an
-- exponent of *where the run has got to* rather than stepped on at a boundary
-- (Spawner:scale) -- so hp climbs smoothly through the ten minutes and carries
-- on climbing through the next ten, while damage steps once a cycle. hp can
-- afford to be continuous because a tougher blob is a longer fight; damage
-- cannot, because a blob that hits for a fraction more every minute is a blob
-- nobody can learn.
--
-- **hp is per minute and damage is per cycle, and the two units are the
-- difference between them.** A minute is the unit the player is reading -- it is
-- the clock in the top of the HUD -- so a health curve written per minute is one
-- whose steepness can be checked against the thing on screen, and 15% a minute
-- compounding is the whole difficulty ramp of this game in one number:
--
--     minute  1   x1.00   a blob is 4hp   -- one hit from the pencil's four
--     minute  5   x1.75   a blob is 7hp   -- two
--     minute 10   x3.52   a blob is 14hp  -- four, and the eye walks on
--     minute 15   x7.08   a blob is 28hp  -- seven
--
-- Which is the answer to the question this number exists to answer: the thing
-- you opened the run one-shotting takes most of a magazine by the time an
-- endless run is halfway through its second cycle, and it got there without a
-- single step a player could point at.
--
-- The first HP_GRACE seconds do not scale at all, and that minute is doing real
-- work rather than being a rounding of the curve. A run at ten seconds is a run
-- with no draft behind it and a player still learning which way the gesture
-- goes; anything above 1.0 there turns the game's most basic sentence -- the
-- pencil's 4 kills the blob's 4 -- into a lie that costs a second hit. So the
-- ramp starts at minute one, and everything before it is the sentence.
local HP_PER_MINUTE = 1.15
local HP_GRACE = 60
local DAMAGE_PER_CYCLE = 1.18

-- And what time adds to the *legs*, which is the one thing time scales here with
-- a ceiling written into the shape of the curve rather than a number in front of
-- it.
--
-- hp can compound for ever because a tougher blob is a longer fight. Speed
-- cannot, because a blob quicker than the player is not a longer fight -- it is
-- the end of the only counterplay the whole horde has, which is that you can
-- *leave*. And the margin is not generous: the fastest walker in the game is the
-- bat's 38 against a player's 58 (`SPEED` in src/player.lua), so an exponent as
-- small as 1% a minute draws the two level by minute 32 and 1.5% by minute 21 --
-- cycle four and cycle three, both of them inside an endless run rather than
-- past the end of one. Measured against a player who does nothing but run away,
-- 1.5% a minute has a doctorate's cycle three touching him two thousand times a
-- minute. That is not a harder run; it is a run with the horde's counterplay
-- taken out of it.
--
-- So the shape is an approach and not a climb: the horde walks *towards* a speed
-- SPEED_MOST above the row and never arrives, halving what is left of the gap
-- every SPEED_HALF minutes. Two things fall out of that, and both are why it is
-- this rather than a `math.min` over an exponent. There is no minute at which
-- the ramp stops, so there is no cliff in it -- a capped exponent tops out
-- around minute seven and every minute after that is flat, which reads as the
-- game having given up. And the ceiling is on the *ramp*, so it multiplies the
-- course's own 4% a rung (src/course.lua) instead of competing with it: a
-- ceiling on the product is the tidier line and it quietly eats that dial, since
-- a doctorate would reach it by minute three and a half and all four classes
-- would walk at exactly the same speed from there on.
--
--     minute  0   x1.00   a bat is 38   -- 66% of the player's 58
--     minute  6   x1.09   a bat is 41
--     minute 20   x1.16   a bat is 44
--     minute 60   x1.18   a bat is 45   -- 77%, and it never gets past that
--
-- 18% is read off the far end of that column rather than the near one, because
-- it is the doctorate's number that has to stay under the player: x1.32 at the
-- top of the ladder, which is a bat at 50 against 58. It also keeps the one
-- invariant the wad's lunge is built on -- 165px a second for 0.42s is 69px
-- against a 96px trigger range, so the charge closes distance and never crosses
-- it in one go -- 92px with four still to spare at the top of both curves.
local SPEED_MOST = 0.18
local SPEED_HALF = 6

-- And what a *cycle* adds to the eye, which is not on the curve above.
--
-- The boss's 900 is the one number in Enemy.types set by measurement rather than
-- by design -- it is what makes the fight half a minute long for a strong run --
-- and a per-minute health curve would put it somewhere nobody measured: 15% a
-- minute reaches x3.5 by the time the first eye walks on, so the fight the game
-- was tuned around would arrive at three thousand health instead of 1260.
--
-- So the eye keeps the curve the horde used to be on, read per cycle, which
-- leaves the first one at exactly the 1260 it was tuned to and each one after it
-- 40% heavier than the last. That is the right unit for it anyway: there is one
-- eye per cycle, you meet it once, and what should be true of it is that this
-- cycle's is harder than last cycle's -- not that it grew while you walked to it.
local BOSS_HP_PER_CYCLE = 1.4

-- { kind, unlocked at (seconds), weight }
--
-- Nine rows over ten minutes, which is a new thing to look at roughly every
-- eighty seconds for the whole of a cycle. That spacing is the point of the
-- column: a run's difficulty already climbs continuously (Spawner:scale) and a
-- continuous climb is not something a player can *see*. What they can see is the
-- minute a shape they have never met walks over the edge, and there should be
-- one of those left for as long as the cycle lasts -- the old table spent its
-- last unlock at 450 and then had nothing to say for two and a half minutes.
--
-- They are ordered by what they ask of you rather than by how hard they are.
-- Blob and bat are the page (walk away, or don't). The wad is the first thing
-- that asks for a reaction rather than a plan. The blot is the first that asks
-- what your damage is *shaped* like. The skull is the wall. The bulb is the
-- first that makes where you fight matter. The eye is range. The grin is the
-- first thing your crowd control cannot fully answer, and the redeye is the
-- first that will not come to you -- the two that arrive last are the two that
-- take something away from a build rather than adding something to the page,
-- and a build has to exist before either is a lesson.
--
-- `drop` is not here and never will be: nothing spawns one, they fall off a
-- blot (Game:splitEnemy).
--
-- The weights hold the shape the game shipped with -- blob and bat are half the
-- horde between them and everything else is trim. Nine kinds sharing the other
-- half means no single one of them is common, which is correct: the wad, the
-- bulb and the grin are all *events*, and an event that happens six times a
-- minute is weather.

-- Champions: the same monster drawn twice the size and several times as hard to
-- put down (Enemy.new, Sprite:draw).
--
-- It is not a row in the table above and deliberately so. An elite is a fact
-- about one *arrival* rather than about a kind, so it costs no art, no
-- behaviour and no unlock time, and every kind that ever gets added is elite-able
-- the day it lands. It arrives as a multiplied scale for the same reason the
-- cycle's difficulty does -- which is also what makes the reward free: xp rides
-- the hp multiplier (Enemy.new), so something 3.6 times as long to kill is worth
-- 3.6 times as much without a second number anywhere.
--
-- The mark used to be a rim of heavier ink and is now the size, and that is the
-- one thing about this row that is no longer free: a rim reads at any distance and
-- costs no page, while ELITE_GROW spends four times the paper on every seventh
-- arrival. What it buys is a mark that survives the crowd it has to be read in --
-- a one-pixel rim on a body touching four others is a rim you have to hunt for,
-- and a body twice the size of the ones around it is not. The radius grows with
-- the drawing (Enemy.new), so a champion is now also harder to miss and harder to
-- squeeze past than the row it came from, which the rim never was: what was one
-- sentence about health is two, and the second one is about the page.
--
-- 3.6 and 1.25 are a deliberate mismatch. What an elite should be is a *target*
-- -- something in the crowd worth turning towards and spending a cooldown on --
-- and that wants health, not damage: an elite bat that hits like a skull is a
-- thing that killed you from off screen, while an elite bat that takes eight
-- times as long to die is a thing you noticed. The damage moves at all only so
-- that walking into one still reads as a mistake.
--
-- Nothing before ELITE_FROM, because a champion in the third minute is just a
-- blob that took a while, and then a chance that climbs to ELITE_MOST and stops.
-- One in seven is the ceiling on purpose, and it is load-bearing in a way it was
-- not when the mark was ink: past that the double body stops meaning "that one"
-- and starts being how big the horde is.

-- **Blow-ups: the same monster, drawn three times the size.**
--
-- Now that a champion is a size too, the pair is one axis at two magnitudes
-- rather than two axes, and this is the far end of it: the same art at three
-- times the scale, standing on nine times the paper, on five times the health of
-- its row (Enemy.new, Sprite:draw). It costs no art and no behaviour, for the
-- champion's reason -- it is a fact about an arrival.
--
-- What the pair lost by landing on one axis is that they used to be told apart by
-- *kind* -- ink against paper, a health bar against a shape -- and are now told
-- apart by *how much*, which is a weaker thing to ask a player to read in a crowd.
-- Two things buy it back, and both were already here. One is rarity: a champion is
-- a seventh of the horde and a blow-up is a handful in a whole run, so the thing
-- at three times the size is a thing you have almost certainly not seen for a
-- minute, and it is standing next to the doubles rather than among them. The other
-- is that a blow-up is the one of the two that says its own name (BLOWN_NOTICE) --
-- which is what the announcement was always for: telling you the enormous blob is
-- a thing the game meant.
--
-- Three numbers rather than the single factor this used to be, because the size and
-- health have come apart. BLOWN_HP's 5 is above the 3 the size would have priced,
-- since three times across on three times the health is a thing that dies before
-- you have finished walking round it; and it is above a champion's 3.6 by much
-- less than the size is above a champion's 2, which is the whole trade of the row.
-- What a blow-up is for is being *in the way*, and something that was also the
-- longest fight on the page would be a mini-boss wearing a monster's art. Because
-- xp rides the hp multiplier the reward follows the health and not the size, which
-- is the right way round: a run is paid for the killing and never for the paper.
--
-- BLOWN_DAMAGE stays exactly where twice the drawing had put it, and is now the
-- one number here that neither of the other two moved. It could have gone to the
-- size, and three times a grin's 16 is most of a health bar in one contact hit --
-- from the slowest thing in the game, wearing the loudest silhouette in the game,
-- after a line of text with its name on it. Anything that telegraphed that hard
-- and hit that hard would only ever be a punishment for a misread, and it is the
-- champion's mismatch one step further out: the standouts buy health, and the
-- damage moves only enough that walking into one still reads as a mistake.
--
-- What it is *not* is slower. The obvious version of this idea is a lumbering
-- giant you walk away from, and that version is a wall rather than a monster:
-- the thing that makes a big bat frightening is that it is still a bat. A scale
-- does carry a speed now -- the course puts one there (src/course.lua) -- and
-- this is the one branch of Spawner:scale that deliberately leaves it alone at 1
-- times whatever the course said: a blow-up walks at exactly what it is a
-- blow-up of, which is the whole of the idea.
--
-- **The pressure, rather than a chance.** BLOWN_RISE is added to a meter at
-- every arrival and the meter is the chance, so what is actually being tuned is
-- *how many monsters apart* blow-ups are and not how many seconds -- which is
-- the honest unit, since the page spawns three a second when it is filling and
-- almost nothing when it is full. The meter goes back to nothing the moment one
-- lands.
--
-- A flat chance would do neither of the two things this has to do. It clumps:
-- two blow-ups in the same second is a thing a flat roll does regularly and a
-- thing the player will read as the game having changed the rules. And it
-- droughts: a run can go four minutes without one and the idea quietly stops
-- existing. A rising meter cannot do either -- it starts at almost zero, so the
-- one that just landed is the least likely thing to happen next, and it climbs
-- until something gives.
--
-- BLOWN_MOST is the ceiling the climb stops at rather than the chance itself,
-- and what it is for is bounding the drought rather than capping anything: one
-- in a hundred arrivals is reached after about a thousand of them, and a page
-- still spawning at all then produces one inside another hundred. Two minutes
-- is the longest a run can go without one, and it takes a bad roll to get there.
-- BLOWN_HURRY leans on the rise every cycle, so a tenth cycle meets them oftener
-- as well as harder -- but the meter is what is being hurried, never the
-- ceiling, so this can never turn into the horde being made of them. That
-- restraint is the same one ELITE_MOST is under, and now that both marks are
-- sizes it is the same argument twice: a size you see too often stops being a
-- size at all and just becomes how big the crowd is.
--
-- The rise, the ceiling and the hurry together come out at one every half minute of
-- a busy page, nine in the back half of a first cycle and a little over twice
-- that in a fifth. And because the unit is arrivals, how often you meet one is
-- partly a fact about *your build*: a run clearing the page twice as fast is
-- being handed twice as many monsters and therefore twice as many blow-ups,
-- which is the same bargain the floor already offers -- clearing the page buys
-- more page -- and is the right way round.
--
-- Nothing before BLOWN_FROM, in minutes of horde (Spawner:minutes) rather than
-- real seconds, which is the clock the drills read and the clock that makes an
-- endless run work: cycle two starts past every gate, so from minute ten they
-- are simply part of the weather.

-- **Fury: the same monster gone over in red pen.**
--
-- The third fact an arrival can be, and the first one that is not a size. A
-- champion and a blow-up are one axis at two magnitudes -- more paper, more
-- health -- and the axis is used up: a sprite scale is a whole number, so there
-- is no room between 2 and 3 for a third, and 4 is a body wider than the boss.
-- What was left to vary is what the pair deliberately do not touch. Both are
-- *slower to kill*; neither is quicker, and neither hits for much more, because
-- the note over ELITE_DAMAGE is that a standout should be a target and not an
-- ambush. So an enraged arrival is the other monster the horde was missing: the
-- same body at the same size, on exactly the row's health, that gets to you
-- sooner and takes more off you when it does.
--
-- That makes it the one arrival fact that is legible from its *behaviour* rather
-- than from its outline, which is also why it is the one that may stack with the
-- other two. A champion and a blow-up are mutually exclusive because they are
-- both sizes and would add up to a body the page cannot hold; fury is a colour
-- and a pair of multipliers, so an enraged champion is a legible amount of
-- monster and an enraged blow-up is the loudest thing this game can put on a
-- page. Which is the right shape for a rung nobody reaches by accident.
--
-- **The mark is the whole body, in two colours** (Sprites.enraged): the drawing
-- reduced to red where it was mostly made of one mark and ink everywhere else.
-- It costs no paper at all -- the silhouette, the radius and every number
-- measured off the sprite are untouched -- which is what pays for the champion's
-- one extravagance and lets this stack on top of it. The page is a pencil
-- palette on blue ruling, so red and black and nothing else is the loudest a
-- body can be without being bigger, and it is the one mark here that reads the
-- same on a page that has reskinned the crowd.
--
-- **The numbers.** 1.25 on the legs is measured against the one row it matters
-- for: a bat is 38 and the fastest thing in the horde, and 38 through a
-- doctorate's class, the run's own ramp and this comes out at 60 by minute ten
-- and 63 in an endless run, against a player's 58. Over the player is deliberate
-- and it is the whole point of the row -- an enraged bat is the one arrival in
-- the game you cannot simply walk away from, and a bat is 2 health, which is what
-- makes that fair. Everything else stays under: an enraged blob is 31 and an
-- enraged skull 24, so what the multiplier buys the rest of the horde is a
-- shorter breath between you and it rather than a chase.
--
-- 1.5 on damage is above both standouts' and the reason is the mismatch argued
-- over ELITE_DAMAGE, read the other way round. A champion buys health because
-- what it should be is a target; fury buys none, so what it has to be instead is
-- a *threat*, and a thing that arrived faster and hit for what the row always hit
-- for would be a champion with the interesting half taken out. An enraged skull
-- is 18 of a hundred and an enraged grin 24, which is the same arithmetic
-- everything else on the page asks you to do -- and unlike a course's dial it is
-- allowed to move it, because it says so on the body: the note in src/course.lua
-- that a class may not touch what a hit costs you is about the *silent*
-- multiplier on a whole crowd, and this is one arrival wearing red.
--
-- It leaves health alone entirely, which also settles the reward without a
-- second number: xp rides the hp multiplier (Enemy.new), and an enraged blob is
-- not a longer fight, so it pays a blob. A run is paid for the killing.
--
-- **The chance is the blow-up's own meter, run twice.** Same rise, same ceiling,
-- same lean per cycle, its own accumulator -- so the two roll independently and
-- an enraged blow-up is the product of two rare things rather than a third
-- chance somebody has to keep in step. The numbers are written again here rather
-- than read off the BLOWN_ block because they are the same *today* and are not
-- the same *fact*: the blow-up's rise is priced against how much paper the page
-- can carry, and this one against how often a page should hand you something you
-- cannot walk away from.
--
-- Nothing before FURY_FROM, in minutes of horde like the blow-up's gate, and
-- earlier than it because this costs the page nothing. Not from minute zero all
-- the same: the opening minutes are where a player learns what an ordinary body
-- of each row does, and a red one before that teaches nothing -- there is no
-- ordinary to read it against.
--
-- **And it is a doctorate's**, which is the one thing here that is not a fact
-- about an arrival: the gate is the course's own dial (`fury` in src/course.lua)
-- rather than a rung named in this file, because how hard the book is has been
-- exactly one table's business since the courses went in. Zero on the first
-- three rungs is a meter that never climbs, which is the honest way to spell
-- "never" for something that is metered rather than rolled.

-- **Drills: the shape an arrival has.**
--
-- Everything above this answers *how many* and *what*. A drill answers *from
-- where*, and it exists because the honest reading of the ramp above is that it
-- runs out of things to say around minute five: the wave timer is pinned at its
-- floor, the page is at its cap, and the only variable left is more of the same
-- at once. This is the other axis, and it is the one the ramp cannot reach.
--
-- What it is really fixing is that the page is *isotropic*. The horde arrives on
-- a uniformly random bearing every other second of the run, which averages out
-- to pressure from everywhere -- so running is a thing you do to buy a second
-- rather than a decision about anything, and there is no such thing as a good
-- place to stand. A wall coming over one edge is a decision.

--     RING    the circle closes -- there is no round it, only through

--     PINCER  two walls, opposite edges -- the answer to having run from one
--     GRID    a block in step, evenly spaced -- the page itself walking at you
--
-- They arrive through the ordinary path (Spawner:dropAt), which is the whole of
-- the rule: a drill is the horde of *that minute*, with that minute's health,
-- that minute's unlocks and that minute's champions, standing somewhere a random
-- bearing would never have put it. A subject may shape an arrival; it may never
-- price one. That is what keeps two lessons comparable while making them
-- different games to play.

-- Marching is `Enemy:lure` and nothing new (src/enemy.lua). A lured monster
-- walks at a point instead of at you, and every member of a wall is lured at
-- *its own* point straight across the page -- offset along the wall by exactly
-- the amount it was spawned by -- which is what keeps the wall parallel instead
-- of a funnel that collapses onto the player in the first second.
--
-- The lure lapses rather than being cancelled, and that moment is the point of
-- the whole event: a wall walks across the page, and somewhere around the middle
-- of it every one of them turns and remembers you are there. Seven seconds is
-- picked off the slow end of the bestiary -- a blob walks 20px a second, so it
-- is most of a page -- and the target is put two rings out so nothing ever
-- arrives at the place it was told to walk to, which would leave it standing.
--
-- It also overrules the shooters' stand-off (`keep` in src/enemy.lua), so a
-- redeye in a wall marches with the wall rather than hanging back at 110px. That
-- is the one place in this game a shooter is somewhere it did not choose to be,
-- and it is worth having: a marching wall with the range in it is a wall you
-- cannot answer by simply not being near it.
local MARCH_HOLD = 7

-- The drills themselves. `count` and `gap` are the first cycle's shape, `at` is
-- the minute of horde a page may first ask for it, and `notice` is what the run
-- calls it out loud the once (Spawner:announce).
--
-- The unlock column is TABLE's idea again and reads off the same clock
-- (Spawner:minutes), which is what makes it survive an endless run without a
-- second rule anywhere: minute ten is cycle two's minute nought, so a run that
-- carries on past the eye arrives at its second cycle with all five already in
-- the bag and never sees the ladder again. The first cycle teaches them one at a
-- time; every cycle after it is the exam.
--
-- The times interleave with TABLE rather than spreading evenly. That column
-- already hands you something new at 0.75, 2, 3.3, 4.7, 6, 7, 8 and 9 minutes,
-- so these sit in its gaps -- which means a first run meets a new *thing* or a
-- new *shape* roughly every forty seconds for the whole ten minutes, and never
-- both in the same breath.
--
-- The order is the order they can be understood in. The wall is first because it
-- is the one whose counterplay is visible from the moment it walks on: it has
-- ends. The ring is second because it is the same event with the ends taken
-- away, and it only means that if you have met the wall. The grid is third as
-- the one that is dangerous for a reason other than its shape -- a block is
-- deep, so it is the one you cannot finish before it reaches you. The pincer is
-- fourth, being two walls and therefore the only one that needs the first to
-- have been understood. And the hot side is last because it is the subtlest: the
-- only one that is a *condition* rather than a thing that happens, and the only
-- one a player can be inside for several seconds without noticing.
--
-- **All five land inside the first cycle, and the unlock order is sorted by how
-- much the pages need them rather than only by how hard they are.** Both of
-- those are constraints, and the second was got wrong twice. The shapes that are
-- some page's *signature* -- the wall, the ring, the grid -- have to unlock early
-- enough to actually be signature, because a page only deals from what has
-- unlocked: with the grid arriving at 8.5 minutes, the two subjects whose entire
-- identity is the grid dealt it about once a run, and with it at 6 they dealt it
-- twice. The hot side is nobody's signature -- every page keeps it as garnish and
-- none is built on it -- so it is the one that can afford to arrive last and be
-- seen least. Nothing may unlock after 7.5 minutes: a sixth drill goes in the
-- gaps, not on the end.

-- The quiet is the interesting one, because it is the only place this game
-- breaks its own rule that clearing the page buys you more page and never a rest
-- (see FLOOR_RATE). It breaks it on purpose and only ever as the *back half* of
-- a swarm: the rule holds everywhere except the eight seconds after the worst
-- fifteen. That is what makes both halves legible -- a lull nobody earned is
-- just a gap in the game, while a lull that arrives when the swarm ends is the
-- swarm ending, which is a thing worth being able to feel.
