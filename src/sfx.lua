-- Every sound in the game -- the foley and the one music track -- and the two
-- things that keep the foley from sounding like a machine: no two plays at the
-- same pitch, and no file at its own volume.
--
-- The recordings arrived at wildly different levels -- the ruler slap peaks at
-- full scale while the rubbing loop sits 46dB under it -- and a Source's
-- volume only goes *down*, so evening them out at play time is impossible for
-- the quiet ones. Instead every file is decoded once at load and its samples
-- are scaled in place to sit at the same perceived level (the gains below were
-- measured against the loudest 300ms of each file), which leaves one number in
-- front of the whole game -- MASTER, what it sounds like at full -- and the
-- player's own volume as a multiplier on that (see `Sfx.volume` below).
--
-- Pitch is randomised a few percent on every play. A pitch shift in OpenAL is
-- a speed change too, which is exactly right for foley: a slightly faster
-- swish is a slightly different swish, not a chipmunked one. The track is the
-- one voice exempt from both of those -- it is streamed rather than decoded, and
-- it is played at written pitch, music being the one thing here that a few
-- percent of speed would put out of tune rather than out of the ordinary.
--
-- Two sounds fire far more often than the rest of the game does -- a hit lands
-- on every enemy every weapon touches, and a gem is picked up on every kill --
-- and for those two the few percent is not enough drift and the common level is
-- too loud. Both take a wider pitch range and a minimum gap between plays,
-- written on their own rows below, so a horde being mown reads as a rattle at a
-- level you can play under rather than as one note held down.

--
-- `music` opens a notch under `volume` rather than level with it, and that notch
-- is the whole of how both are audible at once: the track is a bed playing for as
-- long as the program is open and every effect is a transient laid on top of it,
-- so a bed level with the foley is the thing you hear and the foley is the thing
-- you miss. It is a *default* rather than a ceiling baked into the gain below --

-- the game -- and it is why the page reads 70 against 100 rather than two

--- off the page --------------------------------------------------------------

-- The page going out of sight takes the sound with it. SDL sends the window
-- MINIMIZED on the way out and RESTORED on the way back, which arrive here as
-- love.visible (main.lua). Visibility rather than focus is the honest line:
-- a minimised window is out of sight and goes quiet, while a window merely
-- clicked away from is still on the screen, still running its horde, and still
-- owes the player the sound of it.
--
-- This is the desktop's half of the problem, and the only half a game can reach.
-- A phone put in a pocket is the same bug and cannot be fixed from Lua at all:
-- Android blocks the thread the whole program runs on the moment the activity
-- pauses, and it blocks *inside* the event pump that posts MINIMIZED, so neither
-- that event nor any callback of ours is reached until the app is back on the
-- screen -- while OpenAL, mixing on a thread of its own, plays the bed on into
-- the pocket. That half is fixed in the engine instead: the APK's LOVE is
-- patched to pause the OpenAL device from an SDL event watch, the one thing that
-- does run inside the pause handler (love-android-audio.patch, beside
-- build-android.sh). What reaches this file on a phone is both events at once on
-- the way back in, which cancel each other out -- the audio is already sounding
-- again by then, and the run has already been put down.
--
-- `love.audio.pause()` with nothing named pauses every voice that is playing and
-- hands back the list of them, which is exactly the list to give love.audio.play
-- on the way back in: everything that was sounding resumes where it stopped, the
-- streamed track included, and everything that had already finished stays
