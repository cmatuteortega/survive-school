-- The draft.
--
-- Levelling up holds the run and lays three cards on the page, each with a
-- selection box under it, and you pick one exactly the way the title screen is
-- answered (src/scribble.lua): scribble in the box under the card you want. As
-- everywhere else the answer is armed while the pen is down and committed when
-- it comes off, so a scribble that carries on into the next box changes its
-- mind.
--
-- **The cards do not simply appear.** They slide on -- up off the bottom of the
-- page when they are laid across it, in past the left when they are stacked
-- down it -- and slide back off the same way once one has been answered, and
-- nothing on this screen reads the pen until they have landed (`arriving`). A
-- level lands in the middle of a fight, with a finger already on the page laying
-- tool strokes, and the fifth of a second the cards take to arrive is the fifth
-- of a second that finger has to notice the question. A pointer held down across
-- the slide is stale when it ends, so the first thing the draft ever reads is a
-- press that began after the cards were there to be pressed.
--
-- The same worry is why, under a finger, a card is no longer a target. Tapping
-- one used to fill its box for you; that meant one dab of a finger that was
-- mid-stroke when the level landed could spend a level, on a target a third of
-- the page across, and what is left on a touch screen is a box you scribble in,
-- which is what every other question in this game is. A mouse is another matter
-- (`tapsCards`): a click is aimed, the cursor is on the screen where you can see
-- it, and a button held through the slide is stale like any other press -- so on
-- a computer clicking a card, or its box, answers it.
--
-- The cards are the one thing in this game drawn on paper rather than in ink:
-- they are laid *on* the page, they cover the run frozen underneath, and the
-- three of them are the only thing you can do with the page while they are
-- there. Everything else about them is drawn -- a wonky border that warms up as
-- the box under it fills, and the scribble itself, sitting in the box the way
-- ink sits on paper. Ink that missed every box is not an answer, just ink, and
-- goes under the cards and fades.
--
-- Two cards are not paper. The first level of a tool line hands you the tool
-- itself and spends one of the four places on the strip, and it is sky; a fusion
-- does that *and* spends two finished lines doing it, and it is blush. See
-- `unlocks` and `fuses`.
--
-- What is *in* the cards is none of this file's business: it is handed a list
-- of upgrade lines (src/upgrades.lua) and hands back the id of the one that was
-- circled.
--
-- **And, for a run that has bought any, up to three buttons in the bottom corner**
-- (src/perks.lua -- the ones spent *here*, which is what `spent` on the row says;
-- a retake is spent the frame the run would have ended and has no button on this
-- screen). They are `Hud`'s own box -- the corner button's, drawn through
-- `Hud.drawButton` -- and they are **pressed rather than answered**, which on a
-- screen where everything else is a box you scribble in wants saying out loud:
-- pressing one does not answer the question, it changes what the question is.
-- REROLL asks again, SKIP withdraws it, and EXPEL turns the three boxes from three
-- ways of saying yes into three ways of saying never again -- which is still
-- answered by scribbling one of them, so the one part of this that cannot be taken
-- back is still taken the only way anything here is taken.
--
-- They sit in the corner **opposite the thumb stick** (`Hud.toolSide`), which is
-- the same ergonomic rule the tool column is placed by: one hand walks and the
-- other draws, and everything you press belongs to the thumb that is not on the
-- stick. There is no stick while a run is held, but a corner you have spent the
-- last ten minutes not putting your thumb in is still the corner to put a button
-- in.
--
-- A button with no uses left is drawn grey rather than dropped, because a row that
-- shrank as it was spent would move the buttons beside it; a *line* the run never
-- bought has no button at all, because these are things you have rather than
-- things the screen offers -- and so does a line the run cannot spend on a draft.
